323 ## Setting Up for Development and Launching in Eclipse
324 First make sure that you have a recent version of Eclipse. An Eclipse 2018-09 with the JDK 11 plug-in installed (available from Eclipse Marketplace) will do. You may also want to install the Mercurial Plug-in for Eclipse (MercurialEclipse). The Eclipse Marketplace is available under **Help | Eclipse Marketplace...**.
325 
326 To set Eclipse up for JMC development, do the following:
327 
328 1. First ensure that you have started the jetty server in the first step of building JMC.
329 2. Next open (File | Open...) the Eclipse target platform of interest, for example releng/platform-definitions/platform-definition-photon/platform.target
330 3. In the upper right corner of the platform editor that opens, click the link &quot;Set as Active Target Platform&quot;
331 4. Import the projects you are interested in (core and/or application) into a recent Eclipse.
332 5. If importing the application projects, make sure you create a user library (Preferences | Java/Build Path/User Libraries) named JMC_JDK, and add (Add External JARs...) the following JARs from a JDK 8 (u40 or above) to the User Library:
333  - tools.jar (&lt;JDK&gt;/lib/tools.jar)
334  - jconsole.jar (&lt;JDK&gt;/lib/jconsole.jar)
335  - jfxswt.jar (&lt;JDK&gt;/jre/lib/jfxswt.jar)
336  - jfxrt.jar (&lt;JDK&gt;/jre/lib/ext/jfxrt.jar)
337 
338 Note that importing configuration/ide/eclipse as an Eclipse project should automatically make the development launchers available to you.
