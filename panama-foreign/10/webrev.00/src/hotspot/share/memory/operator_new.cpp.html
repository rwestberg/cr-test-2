 34 // The global operator new should never be called since it will usually indicate
 35 // a memory leak.  Use CHeapObj as the base class of such objects to make it explicit
 36 // that they&#39;re allocated on the C heap.
 37 // Commented out in product version to avoid conflicts with third-party C++ native code.
 38 //
 39 // In C++98/03 the throwing new operators are defined with the following signature:
 40 //
 41 // void* operator new(std::size_tsize) throw(std::bad_alloc);
 42 // void* operator new[](std::size_tsize) throw(std::bad_alloc);
 43 //
 44 // while all the other (non-throwing) new and delete operators are defined with an empty
 45 // throw clause (i.e. &quot;operator delete(void* p) throw()&quot;) which means that they do not
 46 // throw any exceptions (see section 18.4 of the C++ standard).
 47 //
 48 // In the new C++11/14 standard, the signature of the throwing new operators was changed
 49 // by completely omitting the throw clause (which effectively means they could throw any
 50 // exception) while all the other new/delete operators where changed to have a &#39;nothrow&#39;
 51 // clause instead of an empty throw clause.
 52 //
 53 // Unfortunately, the support for exception specifications among C++ compilers is still
 54 // very fragile. While some more strict compilers like AIX xlC or HP aCC reject to
 55 // override the default throwing new operator with a user operator with an empty throw()
 56 // clause, the MS Visual C++ compiler warns for every non-empty throw clause like
 57 // throw(std::bad_alloc) that it will ignore the exception specification. The following
 58 // operator definitions have been checked to correctly work with all currently supported
 59 // compilers and they should be upwards compatible with C++11/14. Therefore
 60 // PLEASE BE CAREFUL if you change the signature of the following operators!
