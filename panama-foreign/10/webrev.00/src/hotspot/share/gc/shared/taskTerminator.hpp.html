 36  * Provides a task termination protocol.
 37  *
 38  * This is an enhanced implementation of Google&#39;s OWST work stealing task termination
 39  * protocol (OWST stands for Optimized Work Stealing Threads).
 40  *
 41  * It is described in the paper:
 42  * &quot;Wessam Hassanein. 2016. Understanding and improving JVM GC work
 43  * stealing at the data center scale. In Proceedings of the 2016 ACM
 44  * SIGPLAN International Symposium on Memory Management (ISMM 2016). ACM,
 45  * New York, NY, USA, 46-54. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/2926697.2926706&quot;
 46  *
 47  * Instead of a dedicated spin-master, our implementation will let spin-master relinquish
 48  * the role before it goes to sleep/wait, allowing newly arrived threads to compete for the role.
 49  * The intention of above enhancement is to reduce spin-master&#39;s latency on detecting new tasks
 50  * for stealing and termination condition.
