 322 recommendations. As a reference, these versions of the toolchains are used, at
 323 the time of writing, by Oracle for the daily builds of the JDK. It should be
 324 possible to compile the JDK with both older and newer versions, but the closer
 325 you stay to this list, the more likely you are to compile successfully without
 326 issues.
 327 
 328  Operating system   Toolchain version
 329  ------------------ -------------------------------------------------------
 330  Linux              gcc 8.3.0
 331  macOS              Apple Xcode 10.1 (using clang 10.0.0)
 332  Solaris            Oracle Solaris Studio 12.6 (with compiler version 5.15)
 333  Windows            Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 update 15.9.16
 334 
 335 All compilers are expected to be able to compile to the C99 language standard,
 336 as some C99 features are used in the source code. Microsoft Visual Studio
 337 doesn&#39;t fully support C99 so in practice shared code is limited to using C99
 338 features that it does support.
 339 
 340 ### gcc
 341 
<span class="line-modified"> 342 The minimum accepted version of gcc is 4.8. Older versions will generate a warning</span>
 343 by `configure` and are unlikely to work.
 344 
 345 The JDK is currently known to be able to compile with at least version 8.3 of
 346 gcc.
 347 
 348 In general, any version between these two should be usable.
 349 
 350 ### clang
 351 
 352 The minimum accepted version of clang is 3.2. Older versions will not be
 353 accepted by `configure`.
 354 
 355 To use clang instead of gcc on Linux, use `--with-toolchain-type=clang`.
 356 
 357 ### Apple Xcode
 358 
 359 The oldest supported version of Xcode is 8.
 360 
 361 You will need the Xcode command lines developers tools to be able to build
 362 the JDK. (Actually, *only* the command lines tools are needed, not the IDE.)

1021 generates output that can run on the build system (the *build* toolchain). Note
1022 that cross-compiling is only supported for gcc at the time being. The gcc
1023 standard is to prefix cross-compiling toolchains with the target denominator.
1024 If you follow this standard, `configure` is likely to pick up the toolchain
1025 correctly.
1026 
1027 The *build* toolchain will be autodetected just the same way the normal
1028 *build*/*target* toolchain will be autodetected when not cross-compiling. If
1029 this is not what you want, or if the autodetection fails, you can specify a
1030 devkit containing the *build* toolchain using `--with-build-devkit` to
1031 `configure`, or by giving `BUILD_CC` and `BUILD_CXX` arguments.
1032 
1033 It is often helpful to locate the cross-compilation tools, headers and
1034 libraries in a separate directory, outside the normal path, and point out that
1035 directory to `configure`. Do this by setting the sysroot (`--with-sysroot`) and
1036 appending the directory when searching for cross-compilations tools
1037 (`--with-toolchain-path`). As a compact form, you can also use `--with-devkit`
1038 to point to a single directory, if it is correctly setup. (See `basics.m4` for
1039 details.)

1049 ### Native Libraries
1050 
1051 You will need copies of external native libraries for the *target* system,
1052 present on the *build* machine while building.
1053 
1054 Take care not to replace the *build* system&#39;s version of these libraries by
1055 mistake, since that can render the *build* machine unusable.
1056 
1057 Make sure that the libraries you point to (ALSA, X11, etc) are for the
1058 *target*, not the *build*, platform.
1059 
1060 #### ALSA
1061 
1062 You will need alsa libraries suitable for your *target* system. For most cases,
1063 using Debian&#39;s pre-built libraries work fine.
1064 
1065 Note that alsa is needed even if you only want to build a headless JDK.
1066 
1067   * Go to [Debian Package Search](https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages) and
1068     search for the `libasound2` and `libasound2-dev` packages for your *target*
