   1 % Building the JDK
   2 
   3 ## TL;DR (Instructions for the Impatient)
   4 
   5 If you are eager to try out building the JDK, these simple steps works most of
   6 the time. They assume that you have installed Mercurial (and Cygwin if running
   7 on Windows) and cloned the top-level JDK repository that you want to build.
   8 
   9  1. [Get the complete source code](#getting-the-source-code): \
  10     `hg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk`
  11 
  12  2. [Run configure](#running-configure): \
  13     `bash configure`
  14 
  15     If `configure` fails due to missing dependencies (to either the
  16     [toolchain](#native-compiler-toolchain-requirements), [build tools](
  17     #build-tools-requirements), [external libraries](
  18     #external-library-requirements) or the [boot JDK](#boot-jdk-requirements)),
  19     most of the time it prints a suggestion on how to resolve the situation on
  20     your platform. Follow the instructions, and try running `bash configure`
  21     again.
  22 
  23  3. [Run make](#running-make): \
  24     `make images`
  25 
  26  4. Verify your newly built JDK: \
  27     `./build/*/images/jdk/bin/java -version`
  28 
  29  5. [Run basic tests](##running-tests): \
  30     `make run-test-tier1`
  31 
  32 If any of these steps failed, or if you want to know more about build
  33 requirements or build functionality, please continue reading this document.
  34 
  35 ## Introduction
  36 
  37 The JDK is a complex software project. Building it requires a certain amount of
  38 technical expertise, a fair number of dependencies on external software, and
  39 reasonably powerful hardware.
  40 
  41 If you just want to use the JDK and not build it yourself, this document is not
  42 for you. See for instance [OpenJDK installation](
  43 http://openjdk.java.net/install) for some methods of installing a prebuilt
  44 JDK.
  45 
  46 ## Getting the Source Code
  47 
  48 Make sure you are getting the correct version. As of JDK 10, the source is no
  49 longer split into separate repositories so you only need to clone one single
  50 repository. At the [OpenJDK Mercurial server](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/) you
  51 can see a list of all available repositories. If you want to build an older version,
  52 e.g. JDK 8, it is recommended that you get the `jdk8u` forest, which contains
  53 incremental updates, instead of the `jdk8` forest, which was frozen at JDK 8 GA.
  54 
  55 If you are new to Mercurial, a good place to start is the [Mercurial Beginner&#39;s
  56 Guide](http://www.mercurial-scm.org/guide). The rest of this document assumes a
  57 working knowledge of Mercurial.
  58 
  59 ### Special Considerations
  60 
  61 For a smooth building experience, it is recommended that you follow these rules
  62 on where and how to check out the source code.
  63 
  64   * Do not check out the source code in a path which contains spaces. Chances
  65     are the build will not work. This is most likely to be an issue on Windows
  66     systems.
  67 
  68   * Do not check out the source code in a path which has a very long name or is
  69     nested many levels deep. Chances are you will hit an OS limitation during
  70     the build.
  71 
  72   * Put the source code on a local disk, not a network share. If possible, use
  73     an SSD. The build process is very disk intensive, and having slow disk
  74     access will significantly increase build times. If you need to use a
  75     network share for the source code, see below for suggestions on how to keep
  76     the build artifacts on a local disk.
  77 
  78   * On Windows, if using [Cygwin](#cygwin), extra care must be taken to make sure
  79     the environment is consistent. It is recommended that you follow this
  80     procedure:
  81 
  82       * Create the directory that is going to contain the top directory of the
  83         JDK clone by using the `mkdir` command in the Cygwin bash shell.
  84         That is, do *not* create it using Windows Explorer. This will ensure
  85         that it will have proper Cygwin attributes, and that it&#39;s children will
  86         inherit those attributes.
  87 
  88       * Do not put the JDK clone in a path under your Cygwin home
  89         directory. This is especially important if your user name contains
  90         spaces and/or mixed upper and lower case letters.
  91 
  92       * Clone the JDK repository using the Cygwin command line `hg` client
  93         as instructed in this document. That is, do *not* use another Mercurial
  94         client such as TortoiseHg.
  95 
  96     Failure to follow this procedure might result in hard-to-debug build
  97     problems.
  98 
  99 ## Build Hardware Requirements
 100 
 101 The JDK is a massive project, and require machines ranging from decent to
 102 powerful to be able to build in a reasonable amount of time, or to be able to
 103 complete a build at all.
 104 
 105 We *strongly* recommend usage of an SSD disk for the build, since disk speed is
 106 one of the limiting factors for build performance.
 107 
 108 ### Building on x86
 109 
 110 At a minimum, a machine with 2-4 cores is advisable, as well as 2-4 GB of RAM.
 111 (The more cores to use, the more memory you need.) At least 6 GB of free disk
 112 space is required (8 GB minimum for building on Solaris).
 113 
 114 Even for 32-bit builds, it is recommended to use a 64-bit build machine, and
 115 instead create a 32-bit target using `--with-target-bits=32`.
 116 
 117 ### Building on sparc
 118 
 119 At a minimum, a machine with 4 cores is advisable, as well as 4 GB of RAM. (The
 120 more cores to use, the more memory you need.) At least 8 GB of free disk space
 121 is required.
 122 
 123 Note: The sparc port is deprecated.
 124 
 125 ### Building on aarch64
 126 
 127 At a minimum, a machine with 8 cores is advisable, as well as 8 GB of RAM.
 128 (The more cores to use, the more memory you need.) At least 6 GB of free disk
 129 space is required.
 130 
 131 If you do not have access to sufficiently powerful hardware, it is also
 132 possible to use [cross-compiling](#cross-compiling).
 133 
 134 ### Building on 32-bit arm
 135 
 136 This is not recommended. Instead, see the section on [Cross-compiling](
 137 #cross-compiling).
 138 
 139 ## Operating System Requirements
 140 
 141 The mainline JDK project supports Linux, Solaris, macOS, AIX and Windows.
 142 Support for other operating system, e.g. BSD, exists in separate &quot;port&quot;
 143 projects.
 144 
 145 In general, the JDK can be built on a wide range of versions of these operating
 146 systems, but the further you deviate from what is tested on a daily basis, the
 147 more likely you are to run into problems.
 148 
 149 This table lists the OS versions used by Oracle when building the JDK. Such
 150 information is always subject to change, but this table is up to date at the
 151 time of writing.
 152 
 153  Operating system   Vendor/version used
 154  -----------------  -------------------------------------------------------
 155  Linux              Oracle Enterprise Linux 6.4 / 7.6
 156  Solaris            Solaris 11.3 SRU 20
 157  macOS              Mac OS X 10.13 (High Sierra)
 158  Windows            Windows Server 2012 R2
 159 
 160 The double version numbers for Linux and Solaris are due to the hybrid model
 161 used at Oracle, where header files and external libraries from an older version
 162 are used when building on a more modern version of the OS.
 163 
 164 The Build Group has a wiki page with [Supported Build Platforms](
 165 https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/Build/Supported+Build+Platforms). From
 166 time to time, this is updated by contributors to list successes or failures of
 167 building on different platforms.
 168 
 169 ### Windows
 170 
 171 Windows XP is not a supported platform, but all newer Windows should be able to
 172 build the JDK.
 173 
 174 On Windows, it is important that you pay attention to the instructions in the
 175 [Special Considerations](#special-considerations).
 176 
 177 Windows is the only non-POSIX OS supported by the JDK, and as such, requires
 178 some extra care. A POSIX support layer is required to build on Windows.
 179 Currently, the only supported such layers are Cygwin and Windows Subsystem for
 180 Linux (WSL). (Msys is no longer supported due to a too old bash; msys2 would
 181 likely be possible to support in a future version but that would require effort
 182 to implement.)
 183 
 184 Internally in the build system, all paths are represented as Unix-style paths,
 185 e.g. `/cygdrive/c/hg/jdk9/Makefile` rather than `C:\hg\jdk9\Makefile`. This
 186 rule also applies to input to the build system, e.g. in arguments to
 187 `configure`. So, use `--with-msvcr-dll=/cygdrive/c/msvcr100.dll` rather than
 188 `--with-msvcr-dll=c:\msvcr100.dll`. For details on this conversion, see the section
 189 on [Fixpath](#fixpath).
 190 
 191 #### Cygwin
 192 
 193 A functioning [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) environment is required for
 194 building the JDK on Windows. If you have a 64-bit OS, we strongly recommend
 195 using the 64-bit version of Cygwin.
 196 
 197 **Note:** Cygwin has a model of continuously updating all packages without any
 198 easy way to install or revert to a specific version of a package. This means
 199 that whenever you add or update a package in Cygwin, you might (inadvertently)
 200 update tools that are used by the JDK build process, and that can cause
 201 unexpected build problems.
 202 
 203 The JDK requires GNU Make 4.0 or greater in Cygwin. This is usually not a
 204 problem, since Cygwin currently only distributes GNU Make at a version above
 205 4.0.
 206 
 207 Apart from the basic Cygwin installation, the following packages must also be
 208 installed:
 209 
 210   * `autoconf`
 211   * `make`
 212   * `zip`
 213   * `unzip`
 214 
 215 Often, you can install these packages using the following command line:
 216 ```
 217 &lt;path to Cygwin setup&gt;/setup-x86_64 -q -P autoconf -P make -P unzip -P zip
 218 ```
 219 
 220 Unfortunately, Cygwin can be unreliable in certain circumstances. If you
 221 experience build tool crashes or strange issues when building on Windows,
 222 please check the Cygwin FAQ on the [&quot;BLODA&quot; list](
 223 https://cygwin.com/faq/faq.html#faq.using.bloda) and the section on [fork()
 224 failures](https://cygwin.com/faq/faq.html#faq.using.fixing-fork-failures).
 225 
 226 #### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
 227 
 228 Windows 10 1809 or newer is supported due to a dependency on the wslpath utility
 229 and support for environment variable sharing through WSLENV. Version 1803 can
 230 work but intermittent build failures have been observed.
 231 
 232 It&#39;s possible to build both Windows and Linux binaries from WSL. To build
 233 Windows binaries, you must use a Windows boot JDK (located in a
 234 Windows-accessible directory). To build Linux binaries, you must use a Linux
 235 boot JDK. The default behavior is to build for Windows. To build for Linux, pass
 236 `--build=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --host=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` to
 237 `configure`.
 238 
 239 If building Windows binaries, the source code must be located in a Windows-
 240 accessible directory. This is because Windows executables (such as Visual Studio
 241 and the boot JDK) must be able to access the source code. Also, the drive where
 242 the source is stored must be mounted as case-insensitive by changing either
 243 /etc/fstab or /etc/wsl.conf in WSL. Individual directories may be corrected
 244 using the fsutil tool in case the source was cloned before changing the mount
 245 options.
 246 
 247 Note that while it&#39;s possible to build on WSL, testing is still not fully
 248 supported.
 249 
 250 ### Solaris
 251 
 252 See `make/devkit/solaris11.1-package-list.txt` for a list of recommended
 253 packages to install when building on Solaris. The versions specified in this
 254 list is the versions used by the daily builds at Oracle, and is likely to work
 255 properly.
 256 
 257 Older versions of Solaris shipped a broken version of `objcopy`. At least
 258 version 2.21.1 is needed, which is provided by Solaris 11 Update 1. Objcopy is
 259 needed if you want to have external debug symbols. Please make sure you are
 260 using at least version 2.21.1 of objcopy, or that you disable external debug
 261 symbols.
 262 
 263 Note: The Solaris port is deprecated.
 264 
 265 ### macOS
 266 
 267 Apple is using a quite aggressive scheme of pushing OS updates, and coupling
 268 these updates with required updates of Xcode. Unfortunately, this makes it
 269 difficult for a project such as the JDK to keep pace with a continuously updated
 270 machine running macOS. See the section on [Apple Xcode](#apple-xcode) on some
 271 strategies to deal with this.
 272 
 273 It is recommended that you use at least Mac OS X 10.13 (High Sierra). At the time
 274 of writing, the JDK has been successfully compiled on macOS 10.12 (Sierra).
 275 
 276 The standard macOS environment contains the basic tooling needed to build, but
 277 for external libraries a package manager is recommended. The JDK uses
 278 [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) in the examples, but feel free to use whatever
 279 manager you want (or none).
 280 
 281 ### Linux
 282 
 283 It is often not much problem to build the JDK on Linux. The only general advice
 284 is to try to use the compilers, external libraries and header files as provided
 285 by your distribution.
 286 
 287 The basic tooling is provided as part of the core operating system, but you
 288 will most likely need to install developer packages.
 289 
 290 For apt-based distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, etc), try this:
 291 ```
 292 sudo apt-get install build-essential
 293 ```
 294 
 295 For rpm-based distributions (Fedora, Red Hat, etc), try this:
 296 ```
 297 sudo yum groupinstall &quot;Development Tools&quot;
 298 ```
 299 
 300 ### AIX
 301 
 302 Please consult the AIX section of the [Supported Build Platforms](
 303 https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/Build/Supported+Build+Platforms) OpenJDK
 304 Build Wiki page for details about which versions of AIX are supported.
 305 
 306 ## Native Compiler (Toolchain) Requirements
 307 
 308 Large portions of the JDK consists of native code, that needs to be compiled to
 309 be able to run on the target platform. In theory, toolchain and operating
 310 system should be independent factors, but in practice there&#39;s more or less a
 311 one-to-one correlation between target operating system and toolchain.
 312 
 313  Operating system   Supported toolchain
 314  ------------------ -------------------------
 315  Linux              gcc, clang
 316  macOS              Apple Xcode (using clang)
 317  Solaris            Oracle Solaris Studio
 318  AIX                IBM XL C/C++
 319  Windows            Microsoft Visual Studio
 320 
 321 Please see the individual sections on the toolchains for version
 322 recommendations. As a reference, these versions of the toolchains are used, at
 323 the time of writing, by Oracle for the daily builds of the JDK. It should be
 324 possible to compile the JDK with both older and newer versions, but the closer
 325 you stay to this list, the more likely you are to compile successfully without
 326 issues.
 327 
 328  Operating system   Toolchain version
 329  ------------------ -------------------------------------------------------
 330  Linux              gcc 8.3.0
 331  macOS              Apple Xcode 10.1 (using clang 10.0.0)
 332  Solaris            Oracle Solaris Studio 12.6 (with compiler version 5.15)
 333  Windows            Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 update 15.9.16
 334 
 335 All compilers are expected to be able to compile to the C99 language standard,
 336 as some C99 features are used in the source code. Microsoft Visual Studio
 337 doesn&#39;t fully support C99 so in practice shared code is limited to using C99
 338 features that it does support.
 339 
 340 ### gcc
 341 
 342 The minimum accepted version of gcc is 5.0. Older versions will generate a warning
 343 by `configure` and are unlikely to work.
 344 
 345 The JDK is currently known to be able to compile with at least version 8.3 of
 346 gcc.
 347 
 348 In general, any version between these two should be usable.
 349 
 350 ### clang
 351 
 352 The minimum accepted version of clang is 3.2. Older versions will not be
 353 accepted by `configure`.
 354 
 355 To use clang instead of gcc on Linux, use `--with-toolchain-type=clang`.
 356 
 357 ### Apple Xcode
 358 
 359 The oldest supported version of Xcode is 8.
 360 
 361 You will need the Xcode command lines developers tools to be able to build
 362 the JDK. (Actually, *only* the command lines tools are needed, not the IDE.)
 363 The simplest way to install these is to run:
 364 ```
 365 xcode-select --install
 366 ```
 367 
 368 It is advisable to keep an older version of Xcode for building the JDK when
 369 updating Xcode. This [blog page](
 370 http://iosdevelopertips.com/xcode/install-multiple-versions-of-xcode.html) has
 371 good suggestions on managing multiple Xcode versions. To use a specific version
 372 of Xcode, use `xcode-select -s` before running `configure`, or use
 373 `--with-toolchain-path` to point to the version of Xcode to use, e.g.
 374 `configure --with-toolchain-path=/Applications/Xcode8.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin`
 375 
 376 If you have recently (inadvertently) updated your OS and/or Xcode version, and
 377 the JDK can no longer be built, please see the section on [Problems with the
 378 Build Environment](#problems-with-the-build-environment), and [Getting
 379 Help](#getting-help) to find out if there are any recent, non-merged patches
 380 available for this update.
 381 
 382 ### Oracle Solaris Studio
 383 
 384 The minimum accepted version of the Solaris Studio compilers is 5.13
 385 (corresponding to Solaris Studio 12.4). Older versions will not be accepted by
 386 configure.
 387 
 388 The Solaris Studio installation should contain at least these packages:
 389 
 390  Package                                            Version
 391  -------------------------------------------------- -------------
 392  developer/solarisstudio-124/backend                12.4-1.0.6.0
 393  developer/solarisstudio-124/c++                    12.4-1.0.10.0
 394  developer/solarisstudio-124/cc                     12.4-1.0.4.0
 395  developer/solarisstudio-124/library/c++-libs       12.4-1.0.10.0
 396  developer/solarisstudio-124/library/math-libs      12.4-1.0.0.1
 397  developer/solarisstudio-124/library/studio-gccrt   12.4-1.0.0.1
 398  developer/solarisstudio-124/studio-common          12.4-1.0.0.1
 399  developer/solarisstudio-124/studio-ja              12.4-1.0.0.1
 400  developer/solarisstudio-124/studio-legal           12.4-1.0.0.1
 401  developer/solarisstudio-124/studio-zhCN            12.4-1.0.0.1
 402 
 403 Compiling with Solaris Studio can sometimes be finicky. This is the exact
 404 version used by Oracle, which worked correctly at the time of writing:
 405 ```
 406 $ cc -V
 407 cc: Sun C 5.13 SunOS_i386 2014/10/20
 408 $ CC -V
 409 CC: Sun C++ 5.13 SunOS_i386 151846-10 2015/10/30
 410 ```
 411 
 412 ### Microsoft Visual Studio
 413 
 414 The minimum accepted version of Visual Studio is 2010. Older versions will not
 415 be accepted by `configure`. The maximum accepted version of Visual Studio is
 416 2019. Versions older than 2017 are unlikely to continue working for long.
 417 
 418 If you have multiple versions of Visual Studio installed, `configure` will by
 419 default pick the latest. You can request a specific version to be used by
 420 setting `--with-toolchain-version`, e.g. `--with-toolchain-version=2015`.
 421 
 422 If you get `LINK: fatal error LNK1123: failure during conversion to COFF: file
 423 invalid` when building using Visual Studio 2010, you have encountered
 424 [KB2757355](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2757355), a bug triggered by a
 425 specific installation order. However, the solution suggested by the KB article
 426 does not always resolve the problem. See [this stackoverflow discussion](
 427 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10888391) for other suggestions.
 428 
 429 ### IBM XL C/C++
 430 
 431 Please consult the AIX section of the [Supported Build Platforms](
 432 https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/Build/Supported+Build+Platforms) OpenJDK
 433 Build Wiki page for details about which versions of XLC are supported.
 434 
 435 
 436 ## Boot JDK Requirements
 437 
 438 Paradoxically, building the JDK requires a pre-existing JDK. This is called the
 439 &quot;boot JDK&quot;. The boot JDK does not, however, have to be a JDK built directly from
 440 the source code available in the OpenJDK Community.  If you are porting the JDK
 441 to a new platform, chances are that there already exists another JDK for that
 442 platform that is usable as boot JDK.
 443 
 444 The rule of thumb is that the boot JDK for building JDK major version *N*
 445 should be a JDK of major version *N-1*, so for building JDK 9 a JDK 8 would be
 446 suitable as boot JDK. However, the JDK should be able to &quot;build itself&quot;, so an
 447 up-to-date build of the current JDK source is an acceptable alternative. If
 448 you are following the *N-1* rule, make sure you&#39;ve got the latest update
 449 version, since JDK 8 GA might not be able to build JDK 9 on all platforms.
 450 
 451 Early in the release cycle, version *N-1* may not yet have been released. In
 452 that case, the preferred boot JDK will be version *N-2* until version *N-1*
 453 is available.
 454 
 455 If the boot JDK is not automatically detected, or the wrong JDK is picked, use
 456 `--with-boot-jdk` to point to the JDK to use.
 457 
 458 ### Getting JDK binaries
 459 
 460 JDK binaries for Linux, Windows and macOS can be downloaded from
 461 [jdk.java.net](http://jdk.java.net). An alternative is to download the
 462 [Oracle JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads). Another
 463 is the [Adopt OpenJDK Project](https://adoptopenjdk.net/), which publishes
 464 experimental prebuilt binaries for various platforms.
 465 
 466 On Linux you can also get a JDK from the Linux distribution. On apt-based
 467 distros (like Debian and Ubuntu), `sudo apt-get install openjdk-&lt;VERSION&gt;-jdk`
 468 is typically enough to install a JDK \&lt;VERSION\&gt;. On rpm-based distros (like
 469 Fedora and Red Hat), try `sudo yum install java-&lt;VERSION&gt;-openjdk-devel`.
 470 
 471 ## External Library Requirements
 472 
 473 Different platforms require different external libraries. In general, libraries
 474 are not optional - that is, they are either required or not used.
 475 
 476 If a required library is not detected by `configure`, you need to provide the
 477 path to it. There are two forms of the `configure` arguments to point to an
 478 external library: `--with-&lt;LIB&gt;=&lt;path&gt;` or `--with-&lt;LIB&gt;-include=&lt;path to
 479 include&gt; --with-&lt;LIB&gt;-lib=&lt;path to lib&gt;`. The first variant is more concise,
 480 but require the include files and library files to reside in a default
 481 hierarchy under this directory. In most cases, it works fine.
 482 
 483 As a fallback, the second version allows you to point to the include directory
 484 and the lib directory separately.
 485 
 486 ### FreeType
 487 
 488 FreeType2 from [The FreeType Project](http://www.freetype.org/) is not required
 489 on any platform. The exception is on Unix-based platforms when configuring such
 490 that the build artifacts will reference a system installed library,
 491 rather than bundling the JDK&#39;s own copy.
 492 
 493   * To install on an apt-based Linux, try running `sudo apt-get install
 494     libfreetype6-dev`.
 495   * To install on an rpm-based Linux, try running `sudo yum install
 496     freetype-devel`.
 497   * To install on Solaris, try running `pkg install system/library/freetype-2`.
 498 
 499 Use `--with-freetype-include=&lt;path&gt;` and `--with-freetype-lib=&lt;path&gt;`
 500 if `configure` does not automatically locate the platform FreeType files.
 501 
 502 ### CUPS
 503 
 504 CUPS, [Common UNIX Printing System](http://www.cups.org) header files are
 505 required on all platforms, except Windows. Often these files are provided by
 506 your operating system.
 507 
 508   * To install on an apt-based Linux, try running `sudo apt-get install
 509     libcups2-dev`.
 510   * To install on an rpm-based Linux, try running `sudo yum install
 511     cups-devel`.
 512   * To install on Solaris, try running `pkg install print/cups`.
 513 
 514 Use `--with-cups=&lt;path&gt;` if `configure` does not properly locate your CUPS
 515 files.
 516 
 517 ### X11
 518 
 519 Certain [X11](http://www.x.org/) libraries and include files are required on
 520 Linux and Solaris.
 521 
 522   * To install on an apt-based Linux, try running `sudo apt-get install
 523     libx11-dev libxext-dev libxrender-dev libxrandr-dev libxtst-dev libxt-dev`.
 524   * To install on an rpm-based Linux, try running `sudo yum install
 525     libXtst-devel libXt-devel libXrender-devel libXrandr-devel libXi-devel`.
 526   * To install on Solaris, try running `pkg install x11/header/x11-protocols
 527     x11/library/libice x11/library/libpthread-stubs x11/library/libsm
 528     x11/library/libx11 x11/library/libxau x11/library/libxcb
 529     x11/library/libxdmcp x11/library/libxevie x11/library/libxext
 530     x11/library/libxrender x11/library/libxrandr x11/library/libxscrnsaver
 531     x11/library/libxtst x11/library/toolkit/libxt`.
 532 
 533 Use `--with-x=&lt;path&gt;` if `configure` does not properly locate your X11 files.
 534 
 535 ### ALSA
 536 
 537 ALSA, [Advanced Linux Sound Architecture](https://www.alsa-project.org/) is
 538 required on Linux. At least version 0.9.1 of ALSA is required.
 539 
 540   * To install on an apt-based Linux, try running `sudo apt-get install
 541     libasound2-dev`.
 542   * To install on an rpm-based Linux, try running `sudo yum install
 543     alsa-lib-devel`.
 544 
 545 Use `--with-alsa=&lt;path&gt;` if `configure` does not properly locate your ALSA
 546 files.
 547 
 548 ### libffi
 549 
 550 libffi, the [Portable Foreign Function Interface Library](
 551 http://sourceware.org/libffi) is required when building the Zero version of
 552 Hotspot.
 553 
 554   * To install on an apt-based Linux, try running `sudo apt-get install
 555     libffi-dev`.
 556   * To install on an rpm-based Linux, try running `sudo yum install
 557     libffi-devel`.
 558 
 559 Use `--with-libffi=&lt;path&gt;` if `configure` does not properly locate your libffi
 560 files.
 561 
 562 ## Build Tools Requirements
 563 
 564 ### Autoconf
 565 
 566 The JDK requires [Autoconf](http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf) on all
 567 platforms. At least version 2.69 is required.
 568 
 569   * To install on an apt-based Linux, try running `sudo apt-get install
 570     autoconf`.
 571   * To install on an rpm-based Linux, try running `sudo yum install
 572     autoconf`.
 573   * To install on macOS, try running `brew install autoconf`.
 574   * To install on Windows, try running `&lt;path to Cygwin setup&gt;/setup-x86_64 -q
 575     -P autoconf`.
 576 
 577 If `configure` has problems locating your installation of autoconf, you can
 578 specify it using the `AUTOCONF` environment variable, like this:
 579 
 580 ```
 581 AUTOCONF=&lt;path to autoconf&gt; configure ...
 582 ```
 583 
 584 ### GNU Make
 585 
 586 The JDK requires [GNU Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make). No other flavors
 587 of make are supported.
 588 
 589 At least version 3.81 of GNU Make must be used. For distributions supporting
 590 GNU Make 4.0 or above, we strongly recommend it. GNU Make 4.0 contains useful
 591 functionality to handle parallel building (supported by `--with-output-sync`)
 592 and speed and stability improvements.
 593 
 594 Note that `configure` locates and verifies a properly functioning version of
 595 `make` and stores the path to this `make` binary in the configuration. If you
 596 start a build using `make` on the command line, you will be using the version
 597 of make found first in your `PATH`, and not necessarily the one stored in the
 598 configuration. This initial make will be used as &quot;bootstrap make&quot;, and in a
 599 second stage, the make located by `configure` will be called. Normally, this
 600 will present no issues, but if you have a very old `make`, or a non-GNU Make
 601 `make` in your path, this might cause issues.
 602 
 603 If you want to override the default make found by `configure`, use the `MAKE`
 604 configure variable, e.g. `configure MAKE=/opt/gnu/make`.
 605 
 606 On Solaris, it is common to call the GNU version of make by using `gmake`.
 607 
 608 ### GNU Bash
 609 
 610 The JDK requires [GNU Bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash). No other shells
 611 are supported.
 612 
 613 At least version 3.2 of GNU Bash must be used.
 614 
 615 ## Running Configure
 616 
 617 To build the JDK, you need a &quot;configuration&quot;, which consists of a directory
 618 where to store the build output, coupled with information about the platform,
 619 the specific build machine, and choices that affect how the JDK is built.
 620 
 621 The configuration is created by the `configure` script. The basic invocation of
 622 the `configure` script looks like this:
 623 
 624 ```
 625 bash configure [options]
 626 ```
 627 
 628 This will create an output directory containing the configuration and setup an
 629 area for the build result. This directory typically looks like
 630 `build/linux-x64-server-release`, but the actual name depends on your specific
 631 configuration. (It can also be set directly, see [Using Multiple
 632 Configurations](#using-multiple-configurations)). This directory is referred to
 633 as `$BUILD` in this documentation.
 634 
 635 `configure` will try to figure out what system you are running on and where all
 636 necessary build components are. If you have all prerequisites for building
 637 installed, it should find everything. If it fails to detect any component
 638 automatically, it will exit and inform you about the problem.
 639 
 640 Some command line examples:
 641 
 642   * Create a 32-bit build for Windows with FreeType2 in `C:\freetype-i586`:
 643     ```
 644     bash configure --with-freetype=/cygdrive/c/freetype-i586 --with-target-bits=32
 645     ```
 646 
 647   * Create a debug build with the `server` JVM and DTrace enabled:
 648     ```
 649     bash configure --enable-debug --with-jvm-variants=server --enable-dtrace
 650     ```
 651 
 652 ### Common Configure Arguments
 653 
 654 Here follows some of the most common and important `configure` argument.
 655 
 656 To get up-to-date information on *all* available `configure` argument, please
 657 run:
 658 ```
 659 bash configure --help
 660 ```
 661 
 662 (Note that this help text also include general autoconf options, like
 663 `--dvidir`, that is not relevant to the JDK. To list only JDK-specific
 664 features, use `bash configure --help=short` instead.)
 665 
 666 #### Configure Arguments for Tailoring the Build
 667 
 668   * `--enable-debug` - Set the debug level to `fastdebug` (this is a shorthand
 669     for `--with-debug-level=fastdebug`)
 670   * `--with-debug-level=&lt;level&gt;` - Set the debug level, which can be `release`,
 671     `fastdebug`, `slowdebug` or `optimized`. Default is `release`. `optimized`
 672     is variant of `release` with additional Hotspot debug code.
 673   * `--with-native-debug-symbols=&lt;method&gt;` - Specify if and how native debug
 674     symbols should be built. Available methods are `none`, `internal`,
 675     `external`, `zipped`. Default behavior depends on platform. See [Native
 676     Debug Symbols](#native-debug-symbols) for more details.
 677   * `--with-version-string=&lt;string&gt;` - Specify the version string this build
 678     will be identified with.
 679   * `--with-version-&lt;part&gt;=&lt;value&gt;` - A group of options, where `&lt;part&gt;` can be
 680     any of `pre`, `opt`, `build`, `major`, `minor`, `security` or `patch`. Use
 681     these options to modify just the corresponding part of the version string
 682     from the default, or the value provided by `--with-version-string`.
 683   * `--with-jvm-variants=&lt;variant&gt;[,&lt;variant&gt;...]` - Build the specified variant
 684     (or variants) of Hotspot. Valid variants are: `server`, `client`,
 685     `minimal`, `core`, `zero`, `custom`. Note that not all
 686     variants are possible to combine in a single build.
 687   * `--with-jvm-features=&lt;feature&gt;[,&lt;feature&gt;...]` - Use the specified JVM
 688     features when building Hotspot. The list of features will be enabled on top
 689     of the default list. For the `custom` JVM variant, this default list is
 690     empty. A complete list of available JVM features can be found using `bash
 691     configure --help`.
 692   * `--with-target-bits=&lt;bits&gt;` - Create a target binary suitable for running
 693     on a `&lt;bits&gt;` platform. Use this to create 32-bit output on a 64-bit build
 694     platform, instead of doing a full cross-compile. (This is known as a
 695     *reduced* build.)
 696 
 697 On Linux, BSD and AIX, it is possible to override where Java by default
 698 searches for runtime/JNI libraries. This can be useful in situations where
 699 there is a special shared directory for system JNI libraries. This setting
 700 can in turn be overriden at runtime by setting the `java.library.path` property.
 701 
 702   * `--with-jni-libpath=&lt;path&gt;` - Use the specified path as a default
 703   when searching for runtime libraries.
 704 
 705 #### Configure Arguments for Native Compilation
 706 
 707   * `--with-devkit=&lt;path&gt;` - Use this devkit for compilers, tools and resources
 708   * `--with-sysroot=&lt;path&gt;` - Use this directory as sysroot
 709   * `--with-extra-path=&lt;path&gt;[;&lt;path&gt;]` - Prepend these directories to the
 710     default path when searching for all kinds of binaries
 711   * `--with-toolchain-path=&lt;path&gt;[;&lt;path&gt;]` - Prepend these directories when
 712     searching for toolchain binaries (compilers etc)
 713   * `--with-extra-cflags=&lt;flags&gt;` - Append these flags when compiling JDK C
 714     files
 715   * `--with-extra-cxxflags=&lt;flags&gt;` - Append these flags when compiling JDK C++
 716     files
 717   * `--with-extra-ldflags=&lt;flags&gt;` - Append these flags when linking JDK
 718     libraries
 719 
 720 #### Configure Arguments for External Dependencies
 721 
 722   * `--with-boot-jdk=&lt;path&gt;` - Set the path to the [Boot JDK](
 723     #boot-jdk-requirements)
 724   * `--with-freetype=&lt;path&gt;` - Set the path to [FreeType](#freetype)
 725   * `--with-cups=&lt;path&gt;` - Set the path to [CUPS](#cups)
 726   * `--with-x=&lt;path&gt;` - Set the path to [X11](#x11)
 727   * `--with-alsa=&lt;path&gt;` - Set the path to [ALSA](#alsa)
 728   * `--with-libffi=&lt;path&gt;` - Set the path to [libffi](#libffi)
 729   * `--with-jtreg=&lt;path&gt;` - Set the path to JTReg. See [Running Tests](
 730     #running-tests)
 731 
 732 Certain third-party libraries used by the JDK (libjpeg, giflib, libpng, lcms
 733 and zlib) are included in the JDK repository. The default behavior of the
 734 JDK build is to use the included (&quot;bundled&quot;) versions of libjpeg, giflib,
 735 libpng and lcms.
 736 For zlib, the system lib (if present) is used except on Windows and AIX.
 737 However the bundled libraries may be replaced by an external version.
 738 To do so, specify `system` as the `&lt;source&gt;` option in these arguments.
 739 (The default is `bundled`).
 740 
 741   * `--with-libjpeg=&lt;source&gt;` - Use the specified source for libjpeg
 742   * `--with-giflib=&lt;source&gt;` - Use the specified source for giflib
 743   * `--with-libpng=&lt;source&gt;` - Use the specified source for libpng
 744   * `--with-lcms=&lt;source&gt;` - Use the specified source for lcms
 745   * `--with-zlib=&lt;source&gt;` - Use the specified source for zlib
 746 
 747 On Linux, it is possible to select either static or dynamic linking of the C++
 748 runtime. The default is static linking, with dynamic linking as fallback if the
 749 static library is not found.
 750 
 751   * `--with-stdc++lib=&lt;method&gt;` - Use the specified method (`static`, `dynamic`
 752     or `default`) for linking the C++ runtime.
 753 
 754 ### Configure Control Variables
 755 
 756 It is possible to control certain aspects of `configure` by overriding the
 757 value of `configure` variables, either on the command line or in the
 758 environment.
 759 
 760 Normally, this is **not recommended**. If used improperly, it can lead to a
 761 broken configuration. Unless you&#39;re well versed in the build system, this is
 762 hard to use properly. Therefore, `configure` will print a warning if this is
 763 detected.
 764 
 765 However, there are a few `configure` variables, known as *control variables*
 766 that are supposed to be overriden on the command line. These are variables that
 767 describe the location of tools needed by the build, like `MAKE` or `GREP`. If
 768 any such variable is specified, `configure` will use that value instead of
 769 trying to autodetect the tool. For instance, `bash configure
 770 MAKE=/opt/gnumake4.0/bin/make`.
 771 
 772 If a configure argument exists, use that instead, e.g. use `--with-jtreg`
 773 instead of setting `JTREGEXE`.
 774 
 775 Also note that, despite what autoconf claims, setting `CFLAGS` will not
 776 accomplish anything. Instead use `--with-extra-cflags` (and similar for
 777 `cxxflags` and `ldflags`).
 778 
 779 ## Running Make
 780 
 781 When you have a proper configuration, all you need to do to build the JDK is to
 782 run `make`. (But see the warning at [GNU Make](#gnu-make) about running the
 783 correct version of make.)
 784 
 785 When running `make` without any arguments, the default target is used, which is
 786 the same as running `make default` or `make jdk`. This will build a minimal (or
 787 roughly minimal) set of compiled output (known as an &quot;exploded image&quot;) needed
 788 for a developer to actually execute the newly built JDK. The idea is that in an
 789 incremental development fashion, when doing a normal make, you should only
 790 spend time recompiling what&#39;s changed (making it purely incremental) and only
 791 do the work that&#39;s needed to actually run and test your code.
 792 
 793 The output of the exploded image resides in `$BUILD/jdk`. You can test the
 794 newly built JDK like this: `$BUILD/jdk/bin/java -version`.
 795 
 796 ### Common Make Targets
 797 
 798 Apart from the default target, here are some common make targets:
 799 
 800   * `hotspot` - Build all of hotspot (but only hotspot)
 801   * `hotspot-&lt;variant&gt;` - Build just the specified jvm variant
 802   * `images` or `product-images` - Build the JDK image
 803   * `docs` or `docs-image` - Build the documentation image
 804   * `test-image` - Build the test image
 805   * `all` or `all-images` - Build all images (product, docs and test)
 806   * `bootcycle-images` - Build images twice, second time with newly built JDK
 807     (good for testing)
 808   * `clean` - Remove all files generated by make, but not those generated by
 809     configure
 810   * `dist-clean` - Remove all files, including configuration
 811 
 812 Run `make help` to get an up-to-date list of important make targets and make
 813 control variables.
 814 
 815 It is possible to build just a single module, a single phase, or a single phase
 816 of a single module, by creating make targets according to these followin
 817 patterns. A phase can be either of `gensrc`, `gendata`, `copy`, `java`,
 818 `launchers`, `libs` or `rmic`. See [Using Fine-Grained Make Targets](
 819 #using-fine-grained-make-targets) for more details about this functionality.
 820 
 821   * `&lt;phase&gt;` - Build the specified phase and everything it depends on
 822   * `&lt;module&gt;` - Build the specified module and everything it depends on
 823   * `&lt;module&gt;-&lt;phase&gt;` - Compile the specified phase for the specified module
 824     and everything it depends on
 825 
 826 Similarly, it is possible to clean just a part of the build by creating make
 827 targets according to these patterns:
 828 
 829   * `clean-&lt;outputdir&gt;` - Remove the subdir in the output dir with the name
 830   * `clean-&lt;phase&gt;` - Remove all build results related to a certain build
 831     phase
 832   * `clean-&lt;module&gt;` - Remove all build results related to a certain module
 833   * `clean-&lt;module&gt;-&lt;phase&gt;` - Remove all build results related to a certain
 834     module and phase
 835 
 836 ### Make Control Variables
 837 
 838 It is possible to control `make` behavior by overriding the value of `make`
 839 variables, either on the command line or in the environment.
 840 
 841 Normally, this is **not recommended**. If used improperly, it can lead to a
 842 broken build. Unless you&#39;re well versed in the build system, this is hard to
 843 use properly. Therefore, `make` will print a warning if this is detected.
 844 
 845 However, there are a few `make` variables, known as *control variables* that
 846 are supposed to be overriden on the command line. These make up the &quot;make time&quot;
 847 configuration, as opposed to the &quot;configure time&quot; configuration.
 848 
 849 #### General Make Control Variables
 850 
 851   * `JOBS` - Specify the number of jobs to build with. See [Build
 852     Performance](#build-performance).
 853   * `LOG` - Specify the logging level and functionality. See [Checking the
 854     Build Log File](#checking-the-build-log-file)
 855   * `CONF` and `CONF_NAME` - Selecting the configuration(s) to use. See [Using
 856     Multiple Configurations](#using-multiple-configurations)
 857 
 858 #### Test Make Control Variables
 859 
 860 These make control variables only make sense when running tests. Please see
 861 [Testing the JDK](testing.html) for details.
 862 
 863   * `TEST`
 864   * `TEST_JOBS`
 865   * `JTREG`
 866   * `GTEST`
 867 
 868 #### Advanced Make Control Variables
 869 
 870 These advanced make control variables can be potentially unsafe. See [Hints and
 871 Suggestions for Advanced Users](#hints-and-suggestions-for-advanced-users) and
 872 [Understanding the Build System](#understanding-the-build-system) for details.
 873 
 874   * `SPEC`
 875   * `CONF_CHECK`
 876   * `COMPARE_BUILD`
 877   * `JDK_FILTER`
 878   * `SPEC_FILTER`
 879 
 880 ## Running Tests
 881 
 882 Most of the JDK tests are using the [JTReg](http://openjdk.java.net/jtreg)
 883 test framework. Make sure that your configuration knows where to find your
 884 installation of JTReg. If this is not picked up automatically, use the
 885 `--with-jtreg=&lt;path to jtreg home&gt;` option to point to the JTReg framework.
 886 Note that this option should point to the JTReg home, i.e. the top directory,
 887 containing `lib/jtreg.jar` etc.
 888 
 889 The [Adoption Group](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/Adoption) provides
 890 recent builds of jtreg [here](
 891 https://adopt-openjdk.ci.cloudbees.com/job/jtreg/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact).
 892 Download the latest `.tar.gz` file, unpack it, and point `--with-jtreg` to the
 893 `jtreg` directory that you just unpacked.
 894 
 895 To execute the most basic tests (tier 1), use:
 896 ```
 897 make run-test-tier1
 898 ```
 899 
 900 For more details on how to run tests, please see the [Testing
 901 the JDK](testing.html) document.

 903 ## Cross-compiling
 904 
 905 Cross-compiling means using one platform (the *build* platform) to generate
 906 output that can ran on another platform (the *target* platform).
 907 
 908 The typical reason for cross-compiling is that the build is performed on a more
 909 powerful desktop computer, but the resulting binaries will be able to run on a
 910 different, typically low-performing system. Most of the complications that
 911 arise when building for embedded is due to this separation of *build* and
 912 *target* systems.
 913 
 914 This requires a more complex setup and build procedure. This section assumes
 915 you are familiar with cross-compiling in general, and will only deal with the
 916 particularities of cross-compiling the JDK. If you are new to cross-compiling,
 917 please see the [external links at Wikipedia](
 918 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_compiler#External_links) for a good start
 919 on reading materials.
 920 
 921 Cross-compiling the JDK requires you to be able to build both for the build
 922 platform and for the target platform. The reason for the former is that we need
 923 to build and execute tools during the build process, both native tools and Java
 924 tools.
 925 
 926 If all you want to do is to compile a 32-bit version, for the same OS, on a
 927 64-bit machine, consider using `--with-target-bits=32` instead of doing a
 928 full-blown cross-compilation. (While this surely is possible, it&#39;s a lot more
 929 work and will take much longer to build.)
 930 
 931 ### Cross compiling the easy way with OpenJDK devkits
 932 
 933 The OpenJDK build system provides out-of-the box support for creating and using
 934 so called devkits. A `devkit` is basically a collection of a cross-compiling
 935 toolchain and a sysroot environment which can easily be used together with the
 936 `--with-devkit` configure option to cross compile the OpenJDK. On Linux/x86_64,
 937 the following command:
 938 ```
 939 bash configure --with-devkit=&lt;devkit-path&gt; --openjdk-target=ppc64-linux-gnu &amp;&amp; make
 940 ```
 941 
 942 will configure and build OpenJDK for Linux/ppc64 assuming that `&lt;devkit-path&gt;`
 943 points to a Linux/x86_64 to Linux/ppc64 devkit.
 944 
 945 Devkits can be created from the `make/devkit` directory by executing:
 946 ```
 947 make [ TARGETS=&quot;&lt;TARGET_TRIPLET&gt;+&quot; ] [ BASE_OS=&lt;OS&gt; ] [ BASE_OS_VERSION=&lt;VER&gt; ]
 948 ```
 949 
 950 where `TARGETS` contains one or more `TARGET_TRIPLET`s of the form
 951 described in [section 3.4 of the GNU Autobook](
 952 https://sourceware.org/autobook/autobook/autobook_17.html). If no
 953 targets are given, a native toolchain for the current platform will be
 954 created. Currently, at least the following targets are known to work:
 955 
 956  Supported devkit targets
 957  -------------------------
 958  x86_64-linux-gnu
 959  aarch64-linux-gnu
 960  arm-linux-gnueabihf
 961  ppc64-linux-gnu
 962  ppc64le-linux-gnu
 963  s390x-linux-gnu
 964 
 965 `BASE_OS` must be one of &quot;OEL6&quot; for Oracle Enterprise Linux 6 or
 966 &quot;Fedora&quot; (if not specified &quot;OEL6&quot; will be the default). If the base OS
 967 is &quot;Fedora&quot; the corresponding Fedora release can be specified with the
 968 help of the `BASE_OS_VERSION` option (with &quot;27&quot; as default version).
 969 If the build is successful, the new devkits can be found in the
 970 `build/devkit/result` subdirectory:
 971 ```
 972 cd make/devkit
 973 make TARGETS=&quot;ppc64le-linux-gnu aarch64-linux-gnu&quot; BASE_OS=Fedora BASE_OS_VERSION=21
 974 ls -1 ../../build/devkit/result/
 975 x86_64-linux-gnu-to-aarch64-linux-gnu
 976 x86_64-linux-gnu-to-ppc64le-linux-gnu
 977 ```
 978 
 979 Notice that devkits are not only useful for targeting different build
 980 platforms. Because they contain the full build dependencies for a
 981 system (i.e. compiler and root file system), they can easily be used
 982 to build well-known, reliable and reproducible build environments. You
 983 can for example create and use a devkit with GCC 7.3 and a Fedora 12
 984 sysroot environment (with glibc 2.11) on Ubuntu 14.04 (which doesn&#39;t
 985 have GCC 7.3 by default) to produce OpenJDK binaries which will run on
 986 all Linux systems with runtime libraries newer than the ones from
 987 Fedora 12 (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04, SLES 11 or RHEL 6).
 988 
 989 ### Boot JDK and Build JDK
 990 
 991 When cross-compiling, make sure you use a boot JDK that runs on the *build*
 992 system, and not on the *target* system.
 993 
 994 To be able to build, we need a &quot;Build JDK&quot;, which is a JDK built from the
 995 current sources (that is, the same as the end result of the entire build
 996 process), but able to run on the *build* system, and not the *target* system.
 997 (In contrast, the Boot JDK should be from an older release, e.g. JDK 8 when
 998 building JDK 9.)
 999 
1000 The build process will create a minimal Build JDK for you, as part of building.
1001 To speed up the build, you can use `--with-build-jdk` to `configure` to point
1002 to a pre-built Build JDK. Please note that the build result is unpredictable,
1003 and can possibly break in subtle ways, if the Build JDK does not **exactly**
1004 match the current sources.
1005 
1006 ### Specifying the Target Platform
1007 
1008 You *must* specify the target platform when cross-compiling. Doing so will also
1009 automatically turn the build into a cross-compiling mode. The simplest way to
1010 do this is to use the `--openjdk-target` argument, e.g.
1011 `--openjdk-target=arm-linux-gnueabihf`. or `--openjdk-target=aarch64-oe-linux`.
1012 This will automatically set the `--build`, `--host` and `--target` options for
1013 autoconf, which can otherwise be confusing. (In autoconf terminology, the
1014 &quot;target&quot; is known as &quot;host&quot;, and &quot;target&quot; is used for building a Canadian
1015 cross-compiler.)
1016 
1017 ### Toolchain Considerations
1018 
1019 You will need two copies of your toolchain, one which generates output that can
1020 run on the target system (the normal, or *target*, toolchain), and one that
1021 generates output that can run on the build system (the *build* toolchain). Note
1022 that cross-compiling is only supported for gcc at the time being. The gcc
1023 standard is to prefix cross-compiling toolchains with the target denominator.
1024 If you follow this standard, `configure` is likely to pick up the toolchain
1025 correctly.
1026 
1027 The *build* toolchain will be autodetected just the same way the normal
1028 *build*/*target* toolchain will be autodetected when not cross-compiling. If
1029 this is not what you want, or if the autodetection fails, you can specify a
1030 devkit containing the *build* toolchain using `--with-build-devkit` to
1031 `configure`, or by giving `BUILD_CC` and `BUILD_CXX` arguments.
1032 
1033 It is often helpful to locate the cross-compilation tools, headers and
1034 libraries in a separate directory, outside the normal path, and point out that
1035 directory to `configure`. Do this by setting the sysroot (`--with-sysroot`) and
1036 appending the directory when searching for cross-compilations tools
1037 (`--with-toolchain-path`). As a compact form, you can also use `--with-devkit`
1038 to point to a single directory, if it is correctly setup. (See `basics.m4` for
1039 details.)
1040 
1041 ### Native Libraries
1042 
1043 You will need copies of external native libraries for the *target* system,
1044 present on the *build* machine while building.
1045 
1046 Take care not to replace the *build* system&#39;s version of these libraries by
1047 mistake, since that can render the *build* machine unusable.
1048 
1049 Make sure that the libraries you point to (ALSA, X11, etc) are for the
1050 *target*, not the *build*, platform.
1051 
1052 #### ALSA
1053 
1054 You will need alsa libraries suitable for your *target* system. For most cases,
1055 using Debian&#39;s pre-built libraries work fine.
1056 
1057 Note that alsa is needed even if you only want to build a headless JDK.
1058 
1059   * Go to [Debian Package Search](https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages) and
1060     search for the `libasound2` and `libasound2-dev` packages for your *target*
1061     system. Download them to /tmp.
1062 
1063   * Install the libraries into the cross-compilation toolchain. For instance:
1064 ```
1065 cd /tools/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian-2012.09-20120921_linux/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libc
1066 dpkg-deb -x /tmp/libasound2_1.0.25-4_armhf.deb .
1067 dpkg-deb -x /tmp/libasound2-dev_1.0.25-4_armhf.deb .
1068 ```
1069 
1070   * If alsa is not properly detected by `configure`, you can point it out by
1071     `--with-alsa`.
1072 
1073 #### X11
1074 
1075 You will need X11 libraries suitable for your *target* system. For most cases,
1076 using Debian&#39;s pre-built libraries work fine.
1077 
1078 Note that X11 is needed even if you only want to build a headless JDK.
1079 
1080   * Go to [Debian Package Search](https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages),
1081     search for the following packages for your *target* system, and download them
1082     to /tmp/target-x11:
1083       * libxi
1084       * libxi-dev
1085       * x11proto-core-dev
1086       * x11proto-input-dev
1087       * x11proto-kb-dev
1088       * x11proto-render-dev
1089       * x11proto-xext-dev
1090       * libice-dev
1091       * libxrender
1092       * libxrender-dev
1093       * libxrandr-dev
1094       * libsm-dev
1095       * libxt-dev
1096       * libx11
1097       * libx11-dev
1098       * libxtst
1099       * libxtst-dev
1100       * libxext
1101       * libxext-dev
1102 
1103   * Install the libraries into the cross-compilation toolchain. For instance:
1104     ```
1105     cd /tools/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian-2012.09-20120921_linux/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libc/usr
1106     mkdir X11R6
1107     cd X11R6
1108     for deb in /tmp/target-x11/*.deb ; do dpkg-deb -x $deb . ; done
1109     mv usr/* .
1110     cd lib
1111     cp arm-linux-gnueabihf/* .
1112     ```
1113 
1114     You can ignore the following messages. These libraries are not needed to
1115     successfully complete a full JDK build.
1116     ```
1117     cp: cannot stat `arm-linux-gnueabihf/libICE.so&#39;: No such file or directory
1118     cp: cannot stat `arm-linux-gnueabihf/libSM.so&#39;: No such file or directory
1119     cp: cannot stat `arm-linux-gnueabihf/libXt.so&#39;: No such file or directory
1120     ```
1121 
1122   * If the X11 libraries are not properly detected by `configure`, you can
1123     point them out by `--with-x`.
1124 
1125 ### Creating And Using Sysroots With qemu-deboostrap
1126 
1127 Fortunately, you can create sysroots for foreign architectures with tools
1128 provided by your OS. On Debian/Ubuntu systems, one could use `qemu-deboostrap` to
1129 create the *target* system chroot, which would have the native libraries and headers
1130 specific to that *target* system. After that, we can use the cross-compiler on the *build*
1131 system, pointing into chroot to get the build dependencies right. This allows building
1132 for foreign architectures with native compilation speed.
1133 
1134 For example, cross-compiling to AArch64 from x86_64 could be done like this:
1135 
1136   * Install cross-compiler on the *build* system:
1137 ```
1138 apt install g++-aarch64-linux-gnu gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
1139 ```
1140 
1141   * Create chroot on the *build* system, configuring it for *target* system:
1142 ```
1143 sudo qemu-debootstrap --arch=arm64 --verbose \
1144        --include=fakeroot,build-essential,libx11-dev,libxext-dev,libxrender-dev,libxrandr-dev,libxtst-dev,libxt-dev,libcups2-dev,libfontconfig1-dev,libasound2-dev,libfreetype6-dev,libpng12-dev \
1145        --resolve-deps jessie /chroots/arm64 http://httpredir.debian.org/debian/
1146 ```
1147 
1148   * Configure and build with newly created chroot as sysroot/toolchain-path:
1149 ```
1150 CC=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc CXX=aarch64-linux-gnu-g++ sh ./configure --openjdk-target=aarch64-linux-gnu --with-sysroot=/chroots/arm64/ --with-toolchain-path=/chroots/arm64/
1151 make images
1152 ls build/linux-aarch64-normal-server-release/
1153 ```
1154 
1155 The build does not create new files in that chroot, so it can be reused for multiple builds
1156 without additional cleanup.
1157 
1158 Architectures that are known to successfully cross-compile like this are:
1159 
1160   Target        `CC`                      `CXX`                       `--arch=...`  `--openjdk-target=...`
1161   ------------  ------------------------- --------------------------- ------------- -----------------------
1162   x86           default                   default                     i386          i386-linux-gnu
1163   armhf         gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf   g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf     armhf         arm-linux-gnueabihf
1164   aarch64       gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu     g++-aarch64-linux-gnu       arm64         aarch64-linux-gnu
1165   ppc64el       gcc-powerpc64le-linux-gnu g++-powerpc64le-linux-gnu   ppc64el       powerpc64le-linux-gnu
1166   s390x         gcc-s390x-linux-gnu       g++-s390x-linux-gnu         s390x         s390x-linux-gnu
1167 
1168 Additional architectures might be supported by Debian/Ubuntu Ports.
1169 
1170 ### Building for ARM/aarch64
1171 
1172 A common cross-compilation target is the ARM CPU. When building for ARM, it is
1173 useful to set the ABI profile. A number of pre-defined ABI profiles are
1174 available using `--with-abi-profile`: arm-vfp-sflt, arm-vfp-hflt, arm-sflt,
1175 armv5-vfp-sflt, armv6-vfp-hflt. Note that soft-float ABIs are no longer
1176 properly supported by the JDK.
1177 
1178 ### Verifying the Build
1179 
1180 The build will end up in a directory named like
1181 `build/linux-arm-normal-server-release`.
1182 
1183 Inside this build output directory, the `images/jdk` will contain the newly
1184 built JDK, for your *target* system.
1185 
1186 Copy these folders to your *target* system. Then you can run e.g.
1187 `images/jdk/bin/java -version`.
1188 
1189 ## Build Performance
1190 
1191 Building the JDK requires a lot of horsepower. Some of the build tools can be
1192 adjusted to utilize more or less of resources such as parallel threads and
1193 memory. The `configure` script analyzes your system and selects reasonable
1194 values for such options based on your hardware. If you encounter resource
1195 problems, such as out of memory conditions, you can modify the detected values
1196 with:
1197 
1198   * `--with-num-cores` -- number of cores in the build system, e.g.
1199     `--with-num-cores=8`.
1200 
1201   * `--with-memory-size` -- memory (in MB) available in the build system, e.g.
1202     `--with-memory-size=1024`
1203 
1204 You can also specify directly the number of build jobs to use with
1205 `--with-jobs=N` to `configure`, or `JOBS=N` to `make`. Do not use the `-j` flag
1206 to `make`. In most cases it will be ignored by the makefiles, but it can cause
1207 problems for some make targets.
1208 
1209 It might also be necessary to specify the JVM arguments passed to the Boot JDK,
1210 using e.g. `--with-boot-jdk-jvmargs=&quot;-Xmx8G&quot;`. Doing so will override the
1211 default JVM arguments passed to the Boot JDK.
1212 
1213 At the end of a successful execution of `configure`, you will get a performance
1214 summary, indicating how well the build will perform. Here you will also get
1215 performance hints. If you want to build fast, pay attention to those!
1216 
1217 If you want to tweak build performance, run with `make LOG=info` to get a build
1218 time summary at the end of the build process.
1219 
1220 ### Disk Speed
1221 
1222 If you are using network shares, e.g. via NFS, for your source code, make sure
1223 the build directory is situated on local disk (e.g. by `ln -s
1224 /localdisk/jdk-build $JDK-SHARE/build`). The performance penalty is extremely
1225 high for building on a network share; close to unusable.
1226 
1227 Also, make sure that your build tools (including Boot JDK and toolchain) is
1228 located on a local disk and not a network share.
1229 
1230 As has been stressed elsewhere, do use SSD for source code and build directory,
1231 as well as (if possible) the build tools.
1232 
1233 ### Virus Checking
1234 
1235 The use of virus checking software, especially on Windows, can *significantly*
1236 slow down building of the JDK. If possible, turn off such software, or exclude
1237 the directory containing the JDK source code from on-the-fly checking.
1238 
1239 ### Ccache
1240 
1241 The JDK build supports building with ccache when using gcc or clang. Using
1242 ccache can radically speed up compilation of native code if you often rebuild
1243 the same sources. Your milage may vary however, so we recommend evaluating it
1244 for yourself. To enable it, make sure it&#39;s on the path and configure with
1245 `--enable-ccache`.
1246 
1247 ### Precompiled Headers
1248 
1249 By default, the Hotspot build uses preccompiled headers (PCH) on the toolchains
1250 were it is properly supported (clang, gcc, and Visual Studio). Normally, this
1251 speeds up the build process, but in some circumstances, it can actually slow
1252 things down.
1253 
1254 You can experiment by disabling precompiled headers using
1255 `--disable-precompiled-headers`.
1256 
1257 ### Icecc / icecream
1258 
1259 [icecc/icecream](http://github.com/icecc/icecream) is a simple way to setup a
1260 distributed compiler network. If you have multiple machines available for
1261 building the JDK, you can drastically cut individual build times by utilizing
1262 it.
1263 
1264 To use, setup an icecc network, and install icecc on the build machine. Then
1265 run `configure` using `--enable-icecc`.
1266 
1267 ### Using sjavac
1268 
1269 To speed up Java compilation, especially incremental compilations, you can try
1270 the experimental sjavac compiler by using `--enable-sjavac`.
1271 
1272 ### Building the Right Target
1273 
1274 Selecting the proper target to build can have dramatic impact on build time.
1275 For normal usage, `jdk` or the default target is just fine. You only need to
1276 build `images` for shipping, or if your tests require it.
1277 
1278 See also [Using Fine-Grained Make Targets](#using-fine-grained-make-targets) on
1279 how to build an even smaller subset of the product.
1280 
1281 ## Troubleshooting
1282 
1283 If your build fails, it can sometimes be difficult to pinpoint the problem or
1284 find a proper solution.
1285 
1286 ### Locating the Source of the Error
1287 
1288 When a build fails, it can be hard to pinpoint the actual cause of the error.
1289 In a typical build process, different parts of the product build in parallel,
1290 with the output interlaced.
1291 
1292 #### Build Failure Summary
1293 
1294 To help you, the build system will print a failure summary at the end. It looks
1295 like this:
1296 
1297 ```
1298 ERROR: Build failed for target &#39;hotspot&#39; in configuration &#39;linux-x64&#39; (exit code 2)
1299 
1300 === Output from failing command(s) repeated here ===

1315 ```
1316 
1317 Let&#39;s break it down! First, the selected configuration, and the top-level
1318 target you entered on the command line that caused the failure is printed.
1319 
1320 Then, between the `Output from failing command(s) repeated here` and `End of
1321 repeated output` the first lines of output (stdout and stderr) from the actual
1322 failing command is repeated. In most cases, this is the error message that
1323 caused the build to fail. If multiple commands were failing (this can happen in
1324 a parallel build), output from all failed commands will be printed here.
1325 
1326 The path to the `failure-logs` directory is printed. In this file you will find
1327 a `&lt;target&gt;.log` file that contains the output from this command in its
1328 entirety, and also a `&lt;target&gt;.cmd`, which contain the complete command line
1329 used for running this command. You can re-run the failing command by executing
1330 `. &lt;path to failure-logs&gt;/&lt;target&gt;.cmd` in your shell.
1331 
1332 Another way to trace the failure is to follow the chain of make targets, from
1333 top-level targets to individual file targets. Between `Make failed targets
1334 repeated here` and `End of repeated output` the output from make showing this
1335 chain is repeated. The first failed recipe will typically contain the full path
1336 to the file in question that failed to compile. Following lines will show a
1337 trace of make targets why we ended up trying to compile that file.
1338 
1339 Finally, some hints are given on how to locate the error in the complete log.
1340 In this example, we would try searching the log file for &quot;`psMemoryPool.o`&quot;.
1341 Another way to quickly locate make errors in the log is to search for &quot;`]
1342 Error`&quot; or &quot;`***`&quot;.
1343 
1344 Note that the build failure summary will only help you if the issue was a
1345 compilation failure or similar. If the problem is more esoteric, or is due to
1346 errors in the build machinery, you will likely get empty output logs, and `No
1347 indication of failed target found` instead of the make target chain.
1348 
1349 #### Checking the Build Log File
1350 
1351 The output (stdout and stderr) from the latest build is always stored in
1352 `$BUILD/build.log`. The previous build log is stored as `build.log.old`. This
1353 means that it is not necessary to redirect the build output yourself if you
1354 want to process it.
1355 
1356 You can increase the verbosity of the log file, by the `LOG` control variable
1357 to `make`. If you want to see the command lines used in compilations, use
1358 `LOG=cmdlines`. To increase the general verbosity, use `LOG=info`, `LOG=debug`
1359 or `LOG=trace`. Both of these can be combined with `cmdlines`, e.g.
1360 `LOG=info,cmdlines`. The `debug` log level will show most shell commands
1361 executed by make, and `trace` will show all. Beware that both these log levels
1362 will produce a massive build log!
1363 
1364 ### Fixing Unexpected Build Failures
1365 
1366 Most of the time, the build will fail due to incorrect changes in the source
1367 code.
1368 
1369 Sometimes the build can fail with no apparent changes that have caused the
1370 failure. If this is the first time you are building the JDK on this particular
1371 computer, and the build fails, the problem is likely with your build
1372 environment. But even if you have previously built the JDK with success, and it
1373 now fails, your build environment might have changed (perhaps due to OS
1374 upgrades or similar). But most likely, such failures are due to problems with
1375 the incremental rebuild.
1376 
1377 #### Problems with the Build Environment
1378 
1379 Make sure your configuration is correct. Re-run `configure`, and look for any
1380 warnings. Warnings that appear in the middle of the `configure` output is also
1381 repeated at the end, after the summary. The entire log is stored in
1382 `$BUILD/configure.log`.
1383 
1384 Verify that the summary at the end looks correct. Are you indeed using the Boot
1385 JDK and native toolchain that you expect?
1386 
1387 By default, the JDK has a strict approach where warnings from the compiler is
1388 considered errors which fail the build. For very new or very old compiler
1389 versions, this can trigger new classes of warnings, which thus fails the build.
1390 Run `configure` with `--disable-warnings-as-errors` to turn of this behavior.
1391 (The warnings will still show, but not make the build fail.)
1392 
1393 #### Problems with Incremental Rebuilds
1394 
1395 Incremental rebuilds mean that when you modify part of the product, only the
1396 affected parts get rebuilt. While this works great in most cases, and
1397 significantly speed up the development process, from time to time complex
1398 interdependencies will result in an incorrect build result. This is the most
1399 common cause for unexpected build problems.
1400 
1401 Here are a suggested list of things to try if you are having unexpected build
1402 problems. Each step requires more time than the one before, so try them in
1403 order. Most issues will be solved at step 1 or 2.
1404 
1405  1. Make sure your repository is up-to-date
1406 
1407     Run `hg pull -u` to make sure you have the latest changes.
1408 
1409  2. Clean build results
1410 
1411     The simplest way to fix incremental rebuild issues is to run `make clean`.
1412     This will remove all build results, but not the configuration or any build
1413     system support artifacts. In most cases, this will solve build errors
1414     resulting from incremental build mismatches.
1415 
1416  3. Completely clean the build directory.
1417 
1418     If this does not work, the next step is to run `make dist-clean`, or
1419     removing the build output directory (`$BUILD`). This will clean all
1420     generated output, including your configuration. You will need to re-run
1421     `configure` after this step. A good idea is to run `make
1422     print-configuration` before running `make dist-clean`, as this will print
1423     your current `configure` command line. Here&#39;s a way to do this:
1424 
1425     ```
1426     make print-configuration &gt; current-configuration
1427     make dist-clean
1428     bash configure $(cat current-configuration)
1429     make
1430     ```
1431 
1432  4. Re-clone the Mercurial repository
1433 
1434     Sometimes the Mercurial repository gets in a state that causes the product
1435     to be un-buildable. In such a case, the simplest solution is often the
1436     &quot;sledgehammer approach&quot;: delete the entire repository, and re-clone it.
1437     If you have local changes, save them first to a different location using
1438     `hg export`.
1439 
1440 ### Specific Build Issues
1441 
1442 #### Clock Skew
1443 
1444 If you get an error message like this:
1445 ```
1446 File &#39;xxx&#39; has modification time in the future.
1447 Clock skew detected. Your build may be incomplete.
1448 ```
1449 then the clock on your build machine is out of sync with the timestamps on the
1450 source files. Other errors, apparently unrelated but in fact caused by the
1451 clock skew, can occur along with the clock skew warnings. These secondary
1452 errors may tend to obscure the fact that the true root cause of the problem is
1453 an out-of-sync clock.
1454 
1455 If you see these warnings, reset the clock on the build machine, run `make
1456 clean` and restart the build.
1457 
1458 #### Out of Memory Errors
1459 
1460 On Solaris, you might get an error message like this:
1461 ```
1462 Trouble writing out table to disk
1463 ```
1464 To solve this, increase the amount of swap space on your build machine.
1465 
1466 On Windows, you might get error messages like this:
1467 ```
1468 fatal error - couldn&#39;t allocate heap
1469 cannot create ... Permission denied
1470 spawn failed
1471 ```
1472 This can be a sign of a Cygwin problem. See the information about solving
1473 problems in the [Cygwin](#cygwin) section. Rebooting the computer might help
1474 temporarily.
1475 
1476 ### Getting Help
1477 
1478 If none of the suggestions in this document helps you, or if you find what you
1479 believe is a bug in the build system, please contact the Build Group by sending
1480 a mail to [build-dev@openjdk.java.net](mailto:build-dev@openjdk.java.net).
1481 Please include the relevant parts of the configure and/or build log.
1482 
1483 If you need general help or advice about developing for the JDK, you can also
1484 contact the Adoption Group. See the section on [Contributing to OpenJDK](
1485 #contributing-to-openjdk) for more information.
1486 
1487 ## Hints and Suggestions for Advanced Users
1488 
1489 ### Setting Up a Repository for Pushing Changes (defpath)
1490 
1491 To help you prepare a proper push path for a Mercurial repository, there exists
1492 a useful tool known as [defpath](
1493 http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/defpath). It will help you setup a
1494 proper push path for pushing changes to the JDK.
1495 
1496 Install the extension by cloning
1497 `http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/defpath` and updating your `.hgrc` file.
1498 Here&#39;s one way to do this:
1499 
1500 ```
1501 cd ~
1502 mkdir hg-ext
1503 cd hg-ext
1504 hg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/defpath
1505 cat &lt;&lt; EOT &gt;&gt; ~/.hgrc
1506 [extensions]
1507 defpath=~/hg-ext/defpath/defpath.py
1508 EOT
1509 ```
1510 
1511 You can now setup a proper push path using:
1512 ```
1513 hg defpath -d -u &lt;your OpenJDK username&gt;
1514 ```
1515 
1516 ### Bash Completion
1517 
1518 The `configure` and `make` commands tries to play nice with bash command-line
1519 completion (using `&lt;tab&gt;` or `&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;`). To use this functionality, make
1520 sure you enable completion in your `~/.bashrc` (see instructions for bash in
1521 your operating system).
1522 
1523 Make completion will work out of the box, and will complete valid make targets.
1524 For instance, typing `make jdk-i&lt;tab&gt;` will complete to `make jdk-image`.
1525 
1526 The `configure` script can get completion for options, but for this to work you
1527 need to help `bash` on the way. The standard way of running the script, `bash
1528 configure`, will not be understood by bash completion. You need `configure` to
1529 be the command to run. One way to achieve this is to add a simple helper script
1530 to your path:
1531 
1532 ```
1533 cat &lt;&lt; EOT &gt; /tmp/configure
1534 #!/bin/bash
1535 if [ \$(pwd) = \$(cd \$(dirname \$0); pwd) ] ; then
1536   echo &gt;&amp;2 &quot;Abort: Trying to call configure helper recursively&quot;
1537   exit 1
1538 fi
1539 
1540 bash \$PWD/configure &quot;\$@&quot;
1541 EOT
1542 chmod +x /tmp/configure
1543 sudo mv /tmp/configure /usr/local/bin
1544 ```
1545 
1546 Now `configure --en&lt;tab&gt;-dt&lt;tab&gt;` will result in `configure --enable-dtrace`.
1547 
1548 ### Using Multiple Configurations
1549 
1550 You can have multiple configurations for a single source repository. When you
1551 create a new configuration, run `configure --with-conf-name=&lt;name&gt;` to create a
1552 configuration with the name `&lt;name&gt;`. Alternatively, you can create a directory
1553 under `build` and run `configure` from there, e.g. `mkdir build/&lt;name&gt; &amp;&amp; cd
1554 build/&lt;name&gt; &amp;&amp; bash ../../configure`.
1555 
1556 Then you can build that configuration using `make CONF_NAME=&lt;name&gt;` or `make
1557 CONF=&lt;pattern&gt;`, where `&lt;pattern&gt;` is a substring matching one or several
1558 configurations, e.g. `CONF=debug`. The special empty pattern (`CONF=`) will
1559 match *all* available configuration, so `make CONF= hotspot` will build the
1560 `hotspot` target for all configurations. Alternatively, you can execute `make`
1561 in the configuration directory, e.g. `cd build/&lt;name&gt; &amp;&amp; make`.
1562 
1563 ### Handling Reconfigurations
1564 
1565 If you update the repository and part of the configure script has changed, the
1566 build system will force you to re-run `configure`.
1567 
1568 Most of the time, you will be fine by running `configure` again with the same
1569 arguments as the last time, which can easily be performed by `make
1570 reconfigure`. To simplify this, you can use the `CONF_CHECK` make control
1571 variable, either as `make CONF_CHECK=auto`, or by setting an environment
1572 variable. For instance, if you add `export CONF_CHECK=auto` to your `.bashrc`
1573 file, `make` will always run `reconfigure` automatically whenever the configure
1574 script has changed.
1575 
1576 You can also use `CONF_CHECK=ignore` to skip the check for a needed configure
1577 update. This might speed up the build, but comes at the risk of an incorrect
1578 build result. This is only recommended if you know what you&#39;re doing.
1579 
1580 From time to time, you will also need to modify the command line to `configure`
1581 due to changes. Use `make print-configure` to show the command line used for
1582 your current configuration.
1583 
1584 ### Using Fine-Grained Make Targets
1585 
1586 The default behavior for make is to create consistent and correct output, at
1587 the expense of build speed, if necessary.
1588 
1589 If you are prepared to take some risk of an incorrect build, and know enough of
1590 the system to understand how things build and interact, you can speed up the
1591 build process considerably by instructing make to only build a portion of the
1592 product.
1593 
1594 #### Building Individual Modules
1595 
1596 The safe way to use fine-grained make targets is to use the module specific
1597 make targets. All source code in the JDK is organized so it belongs to a
1598 module, e.g. `java.base` or `jdk.jdwp.agent`. You can build only a specific
1599 module, by giving it as make target: `make jdk.jdwp.agent`. If the specified
1600 module depends on other modules (e.g. `java.base`), those modules will be built
1601 first.
1602 
1603 You can also specify a set of modules, just as you can always specify a set of
1604 make targets: `make jdk.crypto.cryptoki jdk.crypto.ec jdk.crypto.mscapi
1605 jdk.crypto.ucrypto`
1606 
1607 #### Building Individual Module Phases
1608 
1609 The build process for each module is divided into separate phases. Not all
1610 modules need all phases. Which are needed depends on what kind of source code
1611 and other artifact the module consists of. The phases are:
1612 
1613   * `gensrc` (Generate source code to compile)
1614   * `gendata` (Generate non-source code artifacts)
1615   * `copy` (Copy resource artifacts)
1616   * `java` (Compile Java code)
1617   * `launchers` (Compile native executables)
1618   * `libs` (Compile native libraries)
1619   * `rmic` (Run the `rmic` tool)
1620 
1621 You can build only a single phase for a module by using the notation
1622 `$MODULE-$PHASE`. For instance, to build the `gensrc` phase for `java.base`,
1623 use `make java.base-gensrc`.
1624 
1625 Note that some phases may depend on others, e.g. `java` depends on `gensrc` (if
1626 present). Make will build all needed prerequisites before building the
1627 requested phase.
1628 
1629 #### Skipping the Dependency Check
1630 
1631 When using an iterative development style with frequent quick rebuilds, the
1632 dependency check made by make can take up a significant portion of the time
1633 spent on the rebuild. In such cases, it can be useful to bypass the dependency
1634 check in make.
1635 
1636 &gt; **Note that if used incorrectly, this can lead to a broken build!**
1637 
1638 To achieve this, append `-only` to the build target. For instance, `make
1639 jdk.jdwp.agent-java-only` will *only* build the `java` phase of the
1640 `jdk.jdwp.agent` module. If the required dependencies are not present, the
1641 build can fail. On the other hand, the execution time measures in milliseconds.
1642 
1643 A useful pattern is to build the first time normally (e.g. `make
1644 jdk.jdwp.agent`) and then on subsequent builds, use the `-only` make target.
1645 
1646 #### Rebuilding Part of java.base (JDK\_FILTER)
1647 
1648 If you are modifying files in `java.base`, which is the by far largest module
1649 in the JDK, then you need to rebuild all those files whenever a single file has
1650 changed. (This inefficiency will hopefully be addressed in JDK 10.)
1651 
1652 As a hack, you can use the make control variable `JDK_FILTER` to specify a
1653 pattern that will be used to limit the set of files being recompiled. For
1654 instance, `make java.base JDK_FILTER=javax/crypto` (or, to combine methods,
1655 `make java.base-java-only JDK_FILTER=javax/crypto`) will limit the compilation
1656 to files in the `javax.crypto` package.
1657 
1658 ### Learn About Mercurial
1659 
1660 To become an efficient JDK developer, it is recommended that you invest in
1661 learning Mercurial properly. Here are some links that can get you started:

1667 
1668 ## Understanding the Build System
1669 
1670 This section will give you a more technical description on the details of the
1671 build system.
1672 
1673 ### Configurations
1674 
1675 The build system expects to find one or more configuration. These are
1676 technically defined by the `spec.gmk` in a subdirectory to the `build`
1677 subdirectory. The `spec.gmk` file is generated by `configure`, and contains in
1678 principle the configuration (directly or by files included by `spec.gmk`).
1679 
1680 You can, in fact, select a configuration to build by pointing to the `spec.gmk`
1681 file with the `SPEC` make control variable, e.g. `make SPEC=$BUILD/spec.gmk`.
1682 While this is not the recommended way to call `make` as a user, it is what is
1683 used under the hood by the build system.
1684 
1685 ### Build Output Structure
1686 
1687 The build output for a configuration will end up in `build/&lt;configuration
1688 name&gt;`, which we refer to as `$BUILD` in this document. The `$BUILD` directory
1689 contains the following important directories:
1690 
1691 ```
1692 buildtools/
1693 configure-support/
1694 hotspot/
1695 images/
1696 jdk/
1697 make-support/
1698 support/
1699 test-results/
1700 test-support/
1701 ```
1702 
1703 This is what they are used for:
1704 
1705   * `images`: This is the directory were the output of the `*-image` make
1706     targets end up. For instance, `make jdk-image` ends up in `images/jdk`.
1707 
1708   * `jdk`: This is the &quot;exploded image&quot;. After `make jdk`, you will be able to
1709     launch the newly built JDK by running `$BUILD/jdk/bin/java`.
1710 
1711   * `test-results`: This directory contains the results from running tests.
1712 
1713   * `support`: This is an area for intermediate files needed during the build,
1714     e.g. generated source code, object files and class files. Some noteworthy
1715     directories in `support` is `gensrc`, which contains the generated source
1716     code, and the `modules_*` directories, which contains the files in a
1717     per-module hierarchy that will later be collapsed into the `jdk` directory
1718     of the exploded image.
1719 
1720   * `buildtools`: This is an area for tools compiled for the build platform
1721     that are used during the rest of the build.
1722 
1723   * `hotspot`: This is an area for intermediate files needed when building
1724     hotspot.
1725 
1726   * `configure-support`, `make-support` and `test-support`: These directories
1727     contain files that are needed by the build system for `configure`, `make`
1728     and for running tests.
1729 
1730 ### Fixpath
1731 
1732 Windows path typically look like `C:\User\foo`, while Unix paths look like
1733 `/home/foo`. Tools with roots from Unix often experience issues related to this
1734 mismatch when running on Windows.
1735 
1736 In the JDK build, we always use Unix paths internally, and only just before
1737 calling a tool that does not understand Unix paths do we convert them to
1738 Windows paths.
1739 
1740 This conversion is done by the `fixpath` tool, which is a small wrapper that
1741 modifies unix-style paths to Windows-style paths in command lines. Fixpath is
1742 compiled automatically by `configure`.
1743 
1744 ### Native Debug Symbols
1745 
1746 Native libraries and executables can have debug symbol (and other debug
1747 information) associated with them. How this works is very much platform
1748 dependent, but a common problem is that debug symbol information takes a lot of
1749 disk space, but is rarely needed by the end user.
1750 
1751 The JDK supports different methods on how to handle debug symbols. The
1752 method used is selected by `--with-native-debug-symbols`, and available methods
1753 are `none`, `internal`, `external`, `zipped`.
1754 
1755   * `none` means that no debug symbols will be generated during the build.
1756 
1757   * `internal` means that debug symbols will be generated during the build, and
1758     they will be stored in the generated binary.
1759 
1760   * `external` means that debug symbols will be generated during the build, and
1761     after the compilation, they will be moved into a separate `.debuginfo` file.
1762     (This was previously known as FDS, Full Debug Symbols).
1763 
1764   * `zipped` is like `external`, but the .debuginfo file will also be zipped
1765     into a `.diz` file.
1766 
1767 When building for distribution, `zipped` is a good solution. Binaries built
1768 with `internal` is suitable for use by developers, since they facilitate
1769 debugging, but should be stripped before distributed to end users.
1770 
1771 ### Autoconf Details
1772 
1773 The `configure` script is based on the autoconf framework, but in some details
1774 deviate from a normal autoconf `configure` script.
1775 
1776 The `configure` script in the top level directory of the JDK is just a thin
1777 wrapper that calls `make/autoconf/configure`. This in turn will run `autoconf`
1778 to create the runnable (generated) configure script, as
1779 `.build/generated-configure.sh`. Apart from being responsible for the
1780 generation of the runnable script, the `configure` script also provides
1781 functionality that is not easily expressed in the normal Autoconf framework. As
1782 part of this functionality, the generated script is called.
1783 
1784 The build system will detect if the Autoconf source files have changed, and
1785 will trigger a regeneration of the generated script if needed. You can also
1786 manually request such an update by `bash configure autogen`.
1787 
1788 In previous versions of the JDK, the generated script was checked in at
1789 `make/autoconf/generated-configure.sh`. This is no longer the case.
1790 
1791 ### Developing the Build System Itself
1792 
1793 This section contains a few remarks about how to develop for the build system
1794 itself. It is not relevant if you are only making changes in the product source
1795 code.
1796 
1797 While technically using `make`, the make source files of the JDK does not
1798 resemble most other Makefiles. Instead of listing specific targets and actions
1799 (perhaps using patterns), the basic modus operandi is to call a high-level
1800 function (or properly, macro) from the API in `make/common`. For instance, to
1801 compile all classes in the `jdk.internal.foo` package in the `jdk.foo` module,
1802 a call like this would be made:
1803 
1804 ```
1805 $(eval $(call SetupJavaCompilation, BUILD_FOO_CLASSES, \
1806     SETUP := GENERATE_OLDBYTECODE, \
1807     SRC := $(TOPDIR)/src/jkd.foo/share/classes, \
1808     INCLUDES := jdk/internal/foo, \
1809     BIN := $(SUPPORT_OUTPUTDIR)/foo_classes, \
1810 ))
1811 ```
1812 
1813 By encapsulating and expressing the high-level knowledge of *what* should be
1814 done, rather than *how* it should be done (as is normal in Makefiles), we can
1815 build a much more powerful and flexible build system.
1816 
1817 Correct dependency tracking is paramount. Sloppy dependency tracking will lead
1818 to improper parallelization, or worse, race conditions.
1819 
1820 To test for/debug race conditions, try running `make JOBS=1` and `make
1821 JOBS=100` and see if it makes any difference. (It shouldn&#39;t).
1822 
1823 To compare the output of two different builds and see if, and how, they differ,
1824 run `$BUILD1/compare.sh -o $BUILD2`, where `$BUILD1` and `$BUILD2` are the two
1825 builds you want to compare.
1826 
1827 To automatically build two consecutive versions and compare them, use
1828 `COMPARE_BUILD`. The value of `COMPARE_BUILD` is a set of variable=value
1829 assignments, like this:
1830 ```
1831 make COMPARE_BUILD=CONF=--enable-new-hotspot-feature:MAKE=hotspot
1832 ```
1833 See `make/InitSupport.gmk` for details on how to use `COMPARE_BUILD`.
1834 
1835 To analyze build performance, run with `LOG=trace` and check `$BUILD/build-trace-time.log`.
1836 Use `JOBS=1` to avoid parallelism.
1837 
1838 Please check that you adhere to the [Code Conventions for the Build System](
1839 http://openjdk.java.net/groups/build/doc/code-conventions.html) before
1840 submitting patches.

1842 ## Contributing to the JDK
1843 
1844 So, now you&#39;ve built your JDK, and made your first patch, and want to
1845 contribute it back to the OpenJDK Community.
1846 
1847 First of all: Thank you! We gladly welcome your contribution.
1848 However, please bear in mind that the JDK is a massive project, and we must ask
1849 you to follow our rules and guidelines to be able to accept your contribution.
1850 
1851 The official place to start is the [&#39;How to contribute&#39; page](
1852 http://openjdk.java.net/contribute/). There is also an official (but somewhat
1853 outdated and skimpy on details) [Developer&#39;s Guide](
1854 http://openjdk.java.net/guide/).
1855 
1856 If this seems overwhelming to you, the Adoption Group is there to help you! A
1857 good place to start is their [&#39;New Contributor&#39; page](
1858 https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/Adoption/New+Contributor), or start
1859 reading the comprehensive [Getting Started Kit](
1860 https://adoptopenjdk.gitbooks.io/adoptopenjdk-getting-started-kit/en/). The
1861 Adoption Group will also happily answer any questions you have about
1862 contributing. Contact them by [mail](
1863 http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/adoption-discuss) or [IRC](
1864 http://openjdk.java.net/irc/).
