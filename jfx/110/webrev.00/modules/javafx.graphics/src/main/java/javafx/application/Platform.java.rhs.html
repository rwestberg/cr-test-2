 44      * This method starts the JavaFX runtime. The specified Runnable will then be
 45      * called on the JavaFX Application Thread. In general it is not necessary to
 46      * explicitly call this method, since it is invoked as a consequence of
 47      * how most JavaFX applications are built. However there are valid use cases
 48      * for calling this method directly. Because this method starts the JavaFX
 49      * runtime, there is not yet any JavaFX Application Thread, so it is normal
 50      * that this method is called directly on the main thread of the application.
 51      *
 52      * &lt;p&gt;
 53      * This method may or may not return to the caller before the run method
 54      * of the specified Runnable has been called. In any case, this
 55      * method is not blocked on the specified Runnable being executed.
 56      * Once this method
 57      * returns, you may call {@link #runLater(Runnable)} with additional Runnables.
 58      * Those Runnables will be called, also on the JavaFX Application Thread,
 59      * after the Runnable passed into this method has been called.
 60      * &lt;/p&gt;
 61      *
 62      * &lt;p&gt;As noted, it is normally the case that the JavaFX Application Thread
 63      * is started automatically. It is important that this method only be called
 64      * when the JavaFX runtime has not yet been initialized. Situations where
 65      * the JavaFX runtime is started automatically include:
 66      * &lt;/p&gt;
 67      *
 68      * &lt;ul&gt;
 69      *   &lt;li&gt;For standard JavaFX applications that extend {@link Application}, and
 70      *   use either the Java launcher or one of the launch methods in the
 71      *   Application class to launch the application, the FX runtime is
 72      *   initialized automatically by the launcher before the {@code Application}
 73      *   class is loaded.&lt;/li&gt;
 74      *   &lt;li&gt;For Swing applications that use {@link javafx.embed.swing.JFXPanel}
 75      *   to display FX content, the
 76      *   FX runtime is initialized when the first {@code JFXPanel} instance is
 77      *   constructed.&lt;/li&gt;
 78      *   &lt;li&gt;For SWT application that use {@code FXCanvas} to display FX content,
 79      *   the FX runtime is initialized when the first {@code FXCanvas} instance is
 80      *   constructed.&lt;/li&gt;

 82      *
 83      * &lt;p&gt;When an application does not follow any of these common approaches,
 84      * then it becomes the responsibility of the developer to manually start the
 85      * JavaFX runtime by calling this startup method.
 86      * &lt;/p&gt;
 87      *
 88      * &lt;p&gt;Calling this method when the JavaFX runtime is already running will result in an
 89      * {@link IllegalStateException} being thrown - it is only valid to request
 90      * that the JavaFX runtime be started once.
