 42      * Represents a report of changes done to an {@link ObservableList}. The change may consist of one or more actual
 43      * changes and must be iterated by calling the {@link #next()} method.
 44      *
 45      * Each change must be one of the following:
 46      * &lt;ul&gt;
 47      * &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Permutation change&lt;/b&gt; : {@link #wasPermutated()} returns true in this case.
 48      * The permutation happened at range between {@link #getFrom() from} (inclusive) and {@link #getTo() to} (exclusive) and
 49      * can be queried by calling {@link #getPermutation(int)} method.
 50      * &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Add or remove change&lt;/b&gt; : In this case, at least one of the {@link #wasAdded()}, {@link #wasRemoved()} returns true.
 51      * If both methods return true, {@link #wasReplaced()} will also return true.
 52      * &lt;p&gt;The {@link #getRemoved()} method returns a list of elements that have been
 53      * replaced or removed from the list.
 54      * &lt;p&gt; The range between {@link #getFrom() from} (inclusive) and {@link #getTo() to} (exclusive)
 55      * denotes the sublist of the list that contain new elements. Note that this is a half-open
 56      * interval, so if no elements were added, {@code getFrom()} is equal to {@code getTo()}.
 57      * &lt;p&gt;It is possible to get a list of added elements by calling getAddedSubList().
 58      * &lt;p&gt;Note that in order to maintain correct indexes of the separate add/remove changes, these changes
 59      * &lt;b&gt;must&lt;/b&gt; be sorted by their {@code from} index.
 60      * &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update change&lt;/b&gt; : {@link #wasUpdated()} return true on an update change.
 61      * All elements between {@link #getFrom() from} (inclusive) and {@link #getTo() to} (exclusive) were updated.
 62      * &lt;/ul&gt;
 63      *
 64      * &lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; It&#39;s necessary to call {@link #next()} method before calling
 65      * any other method of {@code Change}. The same applies after calling {@link #reset()}.
 66      * The only methods that works at any time is {@link #getList()}.
 67      *
 68      *&lt;p&gt;
 69      * Typical usage is to observe changes on an ObservableList in order
 70      * to hook or unhook (or add or remove a listener) or in order to maintain
 71      * some invariant on every element in that ObservableList. A common code
 72      * pattern for doing this looks something like the following:&lt;br&gt;
 73      *
 74      * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
 75      * ObservableList&amp;lt;Item&amp;gt; theList = ...;
 76      *
 77      * theList.addListener(new ListChangeListener&amp;lt;Item&amp;gt;() {
 78      *     public void onChanged(Change&amp;lt;Item&amp;gt; c) {
 79      *         while (c.next()) {
 80      *             if (c.wasPermutated()) {
 81      *                 for (int i = c.getFrom(); i &amp;lt; c.getTo(); ++i) {
 82      *                      //permutate
 83      *                 }
 84      *             } else if (c.wasUpdated()) {
 85      *                      //update item
 86      *             } else {
 87      *                 for (Item remitem : c.getRemoved()) {
 88      *                     remitem.remove(Outer.this);
 89      *                 }
 90      *                 for (Item additem : c.getAddedSubList()) {
 91      *                     additem.add(Outer.this);
 92      *                 }
 93      *             }
 94      *         }
 95      *     });
 96      *
 97      * }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 98      * &lt;p&gt;
 99      * &lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; This class directly accesses the source list to acquire information about the changes.
100      * &lt;br&gt; This effectively makes the Change object invalid when another change occurs on the list.
101      * &lt;br&gt; For this reason it is &lt;b&gt;not safe to use this class on a different thread&lt;/b&gt;.
102      * &lt;br&gt; It also means &lt;b&gt;the source list cannot be modified inside the listener&lt;/b&gt; since that would invalidate this Change object
103      * for all subsequent listeners.
104      * &lt;p&gt;
105      * Note: in case the change contains multiple changes of different type, these changes must be in the following order:
106      * &lt;em&gt; permutation change(s), add or remove changes, update changes &lt;/em&gt;
107      * This is because permutation changes cannot go after add/remove changes as they would change the position of added elements.
108      * And on the other hand, update changes must go after add/remove changes because they refer with their indexes to the current
109      * state of the list, which means with all add/remove changes applied.
