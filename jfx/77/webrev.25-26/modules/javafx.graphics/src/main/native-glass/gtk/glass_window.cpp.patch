-// Only useful if the window manager does not support the frame extents extension - in this case

-// if that's not available.
+// It's used when frame extents are not yet received or when the window manager does not support
+// the _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS extension. Gdk functions are based on frame extents but will try harder
