41     // The read/write heaps are reflected in the effects() of this value. The compiler may change
42     // the lowering of a Fence based on the heaps. For example, if a fence does not write anything
43     // then it is understood to be a store-store fence. On x86, this may lead us to not emit any
44     // code, while on ARM we may emit a cheaper fence (dmb ishst instead of dmb ish). We will do
45     // the same optimization for load-load fences, which are expressed as a Fence that writes but
46     // does not read.
47     //
48     // This abstraction allows us to cover all of the fences on x86 and all of the standalone fences
49     // on ARM. X86 really just has one fence: mfence. This fence should be used to protect stores
50     // from being sunk below loads. WTF calls it the storeLoadFence. A classic example is the Steele
51     // barrier:
52     //
53     //     o.f = v  =&gt;  o.f = v
54     //                  if (color(o) == black)
55     //                      log(o)
56     //
57     // We are trying to ensure that if the store to o.f occurs after the collector has started
58     // visiting o, then we will log o. Under sequential consistency, this would work. The collector
59     // would set color(o) to black just before it started visiting. But x86&#39;s illusion of sequential
60     // consistency is broken in exactly just this store-&gt;load ordering case. The store to o.f may
61     // get buffered, and it may occur some time after we have loaded and checked color(o). As well,
62     // the collector&#39;s store to set color(o) to black may get buffered and it may occur some time
63     // after the collector has finished visiting o. Therefore, we need mfences. In B3 we model this
64     // as a Fence that reads and writes some heaps. Setting writes to the empty set will cause B3 to
65     // not emit any barrier on x86.
66     //
67     // On ARM there are many more fences. The Fence instruction is meant to model just two of them:
68     // dmb ish and dmb ishst. You can emit a dmb ishst by using a Fence with an empty write heap.
69     // Otherwise, you will get a dmb ish.
