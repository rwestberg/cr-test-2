 41 // This is largely inspired by StampedLock from Java:
 42 // https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/CountingLock.html
 43 //
 44 // This is simplified a lot compared to StampedLock. Unlike StampedLock, it uses an exclusive lock as a
 45 // fallback. There is no way to acquire a CountingLock for read. The only read access is via optimistic
 46 // read transactions.
 47 //
 48 // CountingLock provides two ways of doing optimistic reads:
 49 //
 50 // - The easy way, where CountingLock does all of the fencing for you. That fencing is free on x86 but
 51 //   somewhat expensive on ARM.
 52 // - The hard way, where you do fencing yourself using Dependency. This allows you to be fenceless on both
 53 //   x86 and ARM.
 54 //
 55 // The latter is important for us because some GC paths are known to be sensitive to fences on ARM.
