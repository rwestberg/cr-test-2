31 /* This file serves as the platform independent redirection header for
32  * platform dependent register information. Each architecture has its own header.
33  *
34  * Each header defines a few important macros that are used in a platform independent
35  * way - see for example jit/RegisterSet.cpp.
36  * - FOR_EACH_GP_REGISTER which lists all available general purpose registers.
37  * - FOR_EACH_FP_REGISTER which lists all available floating point registers.
38  * these take themselves a macro that can filter through the available information
39  * spread accross the four macro arguments.
40  * = 1. id: is an identifier used to specify the register (for example, as an enumerator
41  * in an enum);
42  * = 2. name: is a string constant specifying the name of the identifier;
43  * = 3. isReserved: a boolean (usually 0/1) specifying if this is a reserved register;
44  * = 4. isCalleeSaved: a boolean (usually 0/1) specifying if this is a callee saved register;
45  *
46  * - A few other platform dependent macros can be specified to be used in platform
47  *   dependent files (for example assembler X86Assembler.h).
