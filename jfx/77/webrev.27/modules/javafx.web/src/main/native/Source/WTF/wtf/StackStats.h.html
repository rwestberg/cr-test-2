 36 // various  instrumented points in the code. It will result in noticeable
 37 // performance loss. Hence, this should only be enable when you want to do
 38 // some stats location in your local build. This code is provided here as a
 39 // convenience for collecting that data. It is not meant to be enabled by
 40 // default on release or debug builds.
