37 @discussion Shrinks the memory footprint of the VM by deleting various internal caches,
38  running synchronous garbage collection, and releasing memory back to the OS. Note: this
39  API waits until no JavaScript is running on the stack before it frees any memory. It&#39;s
40  best to call this API when no JavaScript is running on the stack for this reason. However, if
41  you do call this API when JavaScript is running on the stack, the API will wait until all JavaScript
42  on the stack finishes running to free memory back to the OS. Therefore, calling this
43  API may not synchronously free memory.
