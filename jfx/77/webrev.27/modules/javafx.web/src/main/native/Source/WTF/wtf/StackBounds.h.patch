     // This 64k number was picked because a sampling of stack usage differences
     // between consecutive entries into one of the Interpreter::execute...()
     // functions was seen to be as high as 27k. Hence, 64k is chosen as a
     // conservative availability value that is not too large but comfortably
     // exceeds 27k with some buffer for error.
