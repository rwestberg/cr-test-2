 // Signature information is held globally and shared by the entire process to allow all signatures to be unique. This is required when wasm calls another wasm instance, and must work when modules are shared between multiple VMs.
 // Note: signatures are never removed because that would require accounting for all WebAssembly.Module and which signatures they use. The maximum number of signatures is bounded, and isn't worth the counting overhead. We could clear everything when we reach zero outstanding WebAssembly.Module. https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166037
