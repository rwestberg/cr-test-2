  5 
  6 You are receiving a copy of GStreamer, Version: 1.16.1 in either source or
  7 object code in the JavaFX runtime or JavaFX SDK. The terms of the
  8 Oracle license do NOT apply to the GStreamer, Version: 1.16.1; it is
  9 licensed under the following license, separately from the Oracle programs
 10 you receive. If you do not wish to install this library, you may delete
 11 this library:
 12 
 13    - On Linux systems: delete $(JAVA_HOME)/lib/libgstreamer-lite.so
 14    - On Mac OS X systems: delete $(JAVA_HOME)/lib/libgstreamer-lite.dylib
 15    - On Windows systems: delete $(JAVA_HOME)\bin\gstreamer-lite.dll
 16 
 17 A copy of the Oracle modified GStreamer library source code is located
 18 in the following OpenJDK git repository:
 19 
 20    https://github.com/openjdk/jfx
 21 
 22 You can use git to clone the repository or you can browse the
 23 source using a web browser. The root directory of the GStreamer source
 24 code is here:

 33                        Version 2.1, February 1999
 34 
 35  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 36  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 37  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 38  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 39 
 40 [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 41  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 42  the version number 2.1.]
 43 
 44                             Preamble
 45 
 46   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 47 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 48 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 49 free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
 50 
 51   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
 52 specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
 53 Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
 54 can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
 55 this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
 56 strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
 57 
 58   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
 59 not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
 60 you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
 61 for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
 62 it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
 63 it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
 64 these things.
 65 
 66   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 67 distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
 68 rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
 69 you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
 70 
 71   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
 72 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
 73 you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
 74 code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
 75 complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
 76 with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
 77 it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 78 
 79   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
 80 library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
 81 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
 82 
 83   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
 84 there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
 85 modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
 86 that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
 87 author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
 88 introduced by others.
<a name="1" id="anc1"></a><span class="line-modified"> 89 </span>
 90   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
 91 any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
 92 effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
 93 restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
 94 any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
 95 consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
 96 
 97   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
 98 ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
 99 General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
100 is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
101 this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
102 libraries into non-free programs.
103 
104   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
105 a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
106 combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
107 General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
108 entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
109 Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
110 the library.
111 
112   We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it
113 does Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General
114 Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
115 of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
116 are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
117 libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
118 special circumstances.
119 
120   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
121 encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
122 a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
123 allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
124 library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
125 case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
126 software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
127 
128   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
129 programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
130 free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
131 non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
132 operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
133 system.
134 
135   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
136 users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
137 linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
138 that program using a modified version of the Library.
139 
140   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
141 modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
142 &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The
143 former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
144 be combined with the library in order to run.
145 
146                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
147    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
148 
149   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
150 program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
151 other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
152 this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).
153 Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
154 
155   A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data
156 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
157 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
158 
159   The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work
160 which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the
161 Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under
162 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
163 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
164 straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
165 included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)
166 
167   &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
168 making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
169 all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
170 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
171 and installation of the library.
172 
173   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
174 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
175 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
176 such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
177 on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
178 writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
179 and what the program that uses the Library does.
180 
181   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s
182 complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
183 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
184 appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
185 all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
186 warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
187 Library.
188 
189   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
190 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
191 fee.
192 
193   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
194 of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
195 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
196 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
197 
198     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
199 
200     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
201     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
202 
203     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
204     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
205 
206     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
207     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
208     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
209     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
210     in the event an application does not supply such function or
211     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
212     its purpose remains meaningful.
213 
214     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
215     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
216     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
217     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
218     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
219     root function must still compute square roots.)
220 
221 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
222 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
223 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
224 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
225 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
226 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
227 on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
228 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
229 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
230 it.
231 
232 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
233 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
234 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
235 collective works based on the Library.
236 
237 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
238 with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
239 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
240 the scope of this License.
241 
242   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
243 License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
244 this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
245 that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
246 instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
247 ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
248 that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
249 these notices.
250 
251   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
252 that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
253 subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
254 
255   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
256 the Library into a program that is not a library.
257 
258   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
259 derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
260 under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
261 it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
262 must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
263 medium customarily used for software interchange.
264 
265   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
266 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
267 source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
268 distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
269 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
270 
271   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
272 Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
273 linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a
274 work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
275 therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
276 
277   However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library
278 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
279 contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the
280 library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
281 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
282 
283   When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file
284 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
285 derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
286 Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
287 linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
288 threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
289 
290   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
291 structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
292 functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
293 file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
294 work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
295 Library will still fall under Section 6.)
296 
297   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
298 distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
299 Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
300 whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
301 
302   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
303 link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a
304 work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
305 under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
306 modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse
307 engineering for debugging such modifications.
308 
309   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
310 Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
311 this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
312 during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
313 copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
314 directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
315 of these things:
316 
317     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
318     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
319     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
320     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
321     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that
322     uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the
323     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
324     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
325     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
326     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
327     to use the modified definitions.)
328 
329     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
330     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
331     copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer system,
332     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
333     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
334     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
335     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
336 
337     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
338     least three years, to give the same user the materials
339     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
340     than the cost of performing this distribution.
341 
342     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
343     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
344     specified materials from the same place.
345 
346     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
347     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
348 
349   For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the
350 Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for
351 reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
352 the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
353 normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
354 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
355 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
356 the executable.
357 
358   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
359 restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
360 accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
361 use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
362 distribute.
363 
364   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
365 Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
366 facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
367 library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
368 the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
369 permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
370 
371     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
372     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
373     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
374     Sections above.
375 
376     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
377     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
378     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
379 
380   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
381 the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
382 attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
383 distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
384 rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
385 or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
386 terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
387 
388   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
389 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
390 distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
391 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
392 modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
393 Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
394 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
395 the Library or works based on it.
396 
397   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
398 Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
399 original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
400 subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
401 restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.
402 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
403 this License.
404 
405   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
406 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
407 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
408 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
409 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
410 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
411 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
412 may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
413 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
414 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
415 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
416 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
417 
418 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
419 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
420 and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
421 
422 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
423 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
424 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
425 integrity of the free software distribution system which is
426 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
427 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
428 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
429 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
430 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
431 impose that choice.
432 
433 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
434 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
435 
436   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
437 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
438 original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
439 an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
440 so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
441 excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
442 written in the body of this License.
443 
444   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
445 versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
446 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
447 but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
448 
449 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
450 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
451 &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
452 conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
453 the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
454 license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
455 the Free Software Foundation.
456 
457   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
458 programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
459 write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
460 copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
461 Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
462 decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
463 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing

491            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
492 
493   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
494 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
495 everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
496 redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
497 ordinary General Public License).
498 
499   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
500 safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
501 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
502 &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
503 
504     &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
505     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
506 
507     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
508     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
509     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
510     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
511 
512     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
513     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
514     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
515     Lesser General Public License for more details.
516 
517     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
518     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
519     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
520 
521 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
522 
523 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
524 school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if
525 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
526 
527   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
528   library `Frob&#39; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
529 
530   &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990
531   Ty Coon, President of Vice
532 
533 That&#39;s all there is to it!
