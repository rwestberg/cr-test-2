 69 you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

 71   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
 72 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
 73 you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
 74 code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
 75 complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
 76 with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
 77 it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 78 
 79   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
 80 library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
 81 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
 82 
 83   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
 84 there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
 85 modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
 86 that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
 87 author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
 88 introduced by others.

 90   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
 91 any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
 92 effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
 93 restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
 94 any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
 95 consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
 96 
 97   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
 98 ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
 99 General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
100 is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
101 this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
102 libraries into non-free programs.
103 
104   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
105 a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
106 combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
107 General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
108 entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
109 Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
