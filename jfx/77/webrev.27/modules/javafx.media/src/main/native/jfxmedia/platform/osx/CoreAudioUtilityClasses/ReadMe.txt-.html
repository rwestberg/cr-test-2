 7 NOTE: While AudioUnitExamples presents up to date (as of OS X 10.11.x) examples of Version 2 Audio Unit Plugins, with the release of OS X 10.11 Apple introduced the Version 3 Audio Unit Extension API.
 8 
 9 The Audio Unit Extensions API introduces a mechanism for developers to deliver Audio Units to users on iOS and OS X as App Extensions.
10 The same API is available on both iOS and OS X and provides a bridging mechanism for existing Version 2 Audio Units and hosts to work with new Version 3 Audio Units and hosts.
11

26 We encourage Audio Unit developers to adopt and move to the Version 3 Audio Unit Extension model for iOS 9 and OS X 10.11 forward.

30 AudioUnitExamples is a collection of Version 2 AudioUnit sample code. Each project demonstrates how to create an AudioUnit of a specific type (i.e. Effect, Generator, Instrument, MIDI Processor and Offline Effect).
31 
32 AudioUnitEffectExample
33 	This sample builds a simple low pass filter as an Effect AudioUnit with custom view. 
34 AudioUnitGeneratorExample
35 	This sample builds a pink noise generator as a Generator AudioUnit. 
36 AudioUnitInstrumentExample
37 	This sample builds a basic sin wave synth as an Instrument AudioUnit.
38 AudioUnitOfflineEffectExample
39 	This sample builds a simple Offline Effect AudioUnit.
40 AudioUnitMidiProcessorExample
41     This sample buids a pass through midi processor. AU&#39;s of this type process midi input and produce midi output but do not produce any audio.
42 StarterAudioUnitExample (TremoloUnit)
43 	This sample is referenced in the AudioUnit programming guide.

49 Technical note TN2247 describes how to support sandboxing in an AudioUnit

52 
53 Technical note TN2276 contains legacy information regarding Component Manager Based Audio Units (OS X 10.6 and earlier) and Audio
54 Unit Plugins (10.7 and newer). This information is presented for completeness only. The AudioUnitExamples projects all build AUPlugins.

58 Installation
59 ------------
60 To install one of the sample audio unit for testing, place the built audio unit (e.g. FilterDemo.component) to the following directory. 
61 
62 	~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/
63 
64 or to:
65 
66 	/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/
67 
68 
69 Testing the Audio Unit
70 ----------------------
71 To test your Audio Unit after installing it, use an Audio Unit hosting application such as &quot;AU Lab&quot;.  AU Lab is part of the Audio Tools for Xcode. 
72 
73 Please refer to the following technical Q&amp;A (QA1731) on how to download Audio Tools.
